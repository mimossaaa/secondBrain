When I was little, I used to sit by the otter tank at the zoo, mesmerized by how effortlessly they moved through water. Years later, I found myself analyzing that same motion, this time not with awe alone but with physics equations. During the COSMOS program at UC Santa Cruz, I studied the biomechanics of underwater locomotion in both humans and animals. I modeled swimmer and otter movement using Navier-Stokes and Bernoulli’s equations, ran CFD simulations, and tracked motion data to compare them. The result? River otters beat Olympic athletes in efficiency. I placed third in the AEC Science Fair, but what mattered more was realizing that science could connect childhood wonder to rigorous discovery, and that biology could be just as computational as engineering. That sense of connection, between curiosity and capability, and between individuals and institutions, drives how I see STEM.

  

At my public high school in San Francisco’s Excelsior District, science opportunities weren’t just rare. They were invisible. So I started Brain Food Society, a club to help other students like me access research and academic programs. We ran a NASA hackathon team, built school displays, and mentored each other through selective applications. Four of our members were accepted into summer research programs such as SSP and COSMOS. I didn’t just want to “make it” in STEM. I wanted others to come with me. It felt like justice.

  

I brought that same philosophy to my internship at the Seoul Botanic Park, where I led science tours in English, Korean, and French. Translating plant science into public storytelling wasn’t just a language exercise. It was a lesson in making knowledge accessible. I saw how science communication can bridge cultures, spark curiosity, and build a more inclusive world.

  

The world I want to build is one where nature is not something to exploit, but to collaborate with. I plan to use plant genetics and synthetic biology to create climate-resilient crops and carbon-sequestering plants. Growing up with asthma under orange wildfire skies, and watching invasive species choke the native flora of San Bruno Mountain, I’ve seen how environmental breakdown disproportionately affects vulnerable communities. That is why I want to start in research and eventually launch a biotech startup focused on ecological justice. I plan to apply to accelerators like Y Combinator to scale the work where it is needed most.

  

I didn’t have a phone growing up. My school didn’t offer physics until senior year. Most of what I’ve learned in STEM, I taught myself through curiosity, grit, and the belief that science should serve everyone, not just those with access. I named my club Brain Food Society because I think curiosity is the best nourishment. STEM, to me, isn’t just a toolkit. It is a responsibility. And I plan to use it to grow something better. For people, for ecosystems, and for the future.
