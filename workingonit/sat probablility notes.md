Here’s a concise set of notes to help you with the **Probability** section of the SAT Math:

---

### **Basic Probability Concepts**

- **Probability Formula:**
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
  \]
  Where \(P(A)\) is the probability of event \(A\).

- **Complementary Probability:**
  The probability that event \(A\) does *not* occur is:
  \[
  P(\text{Not A}) = 1 - P(A)
  \]

---

### **Types of Events**

- **Independent Events:**
  Two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other.
  
  Probability of both events \(A\) and \(B\) occurring:
  \[
  P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
  \]

- **Dependent Events:**
  When the outcome of one event affects the outcome of another.

  - **Conditional Probability** (Probability of event \(B\) given \(A\) occurred):
    \[
    P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}
    \]

- **Mutually Exclusive Events:**
  Events that cannot happen at the same time (no overlap).

  Probability of either event \(A\) or \(B\) happening:
  \[
  P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
  \]

  If events are **not mutually exclusive**, adjust for overlap:
  \[
  P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
  \]

---

### **Expected Value**

The expected value is the average outcome you would expect if you repeated an experiment many times. For discrete random variables:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \sum (\text{Probability of Outcome} \times \text{Value of Outcome})
\]

---

### **Combinations and Permutations**

- **Permutation** (Order Matters):
  The number of ways to arrange \(r\) objects from a set of \(n\) distinct objects:
  \[
  P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
  \]
  Use permutations when the order of the arrangement matters.

- **Combination** (Order Doesn’t Matter):
  The number of ways to choose \(r\) objects from a set of \(n\) distinct objects:
  \[
  C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
  \]
  Use combinations when order doesn't matter.

---

### **Common SAT Probability Problem Types**

1. **Single Event Probability:**
   - Straightforward use of the probability formula.

2. **Probability of Multiple Events:**
   - Independent: Multiply probabilities.
   - Mutually exclusive: Add probabilities.

3. **"At Least One" Problems:**
   Use complementary probability:
   \[
   P(\text{At least one}) = 1 - P(\text{None})
   \]

4. **Counting Problems with Probability:**
   - Combine permutation/combination knowledge with probability formulas.
   - For example, selecting 2 red marbles from a bag and determining the probability.

---

### **Tips for SAT Probability Questions**
- Read the question carefully to identify whether events are independent, dependent, mutually exclusive, or neither.
- Look out for keywords like "and" (multiply probabilities) and "or" (add probabilities).
- Use complementary probability to simplify "at least" and "not" questions.
- For problems involving multiple steps or conditions, break them down step by step.

Mastering these concepts will help you tackle the probability questions on the SAT Math section with confidence!


Sure, here are some notes on the probability section of the SAT math:

**Basic Concepts**

- **Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring.** It is expressed as a fraction or decimal between 0 and 1.
- **The sum of all possible probabilities for an event is always 1.**
- **Independent events:** The outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event.
- **Dependent events:** The outcome of one event does affect the outcome of another event.

**Key Formulas**

- **Probability of a single event:** P(event) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes
- **Probability of independent events:** P(event A and event B) = P(event A) * P(event B)
- **Probability of dependent events:** P(event A and event B) = P(event A) * P(event B | event A)

**Common SAT Math Probability Questions**

- **Simple probability:** What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a die?
- **Compound probability:** What is the probability of flipping heads on a coin twice in a row?
- **Conditional probability:** If you know that it is raining, what is the probability that you will get wet?
- **Geometric probability:** What is the probability that a randomly chosen point in a square will also be inside a circle inscribed in the square?

**Tips for Solving SAT Math Probability Questions**

- **Read the question carefully.** Make sure you understand what is being asked and what information is given.
- **Identify the type of probability problem.** This will help you determine which formula to use.
- **Break down the problem into steps.** This can help you to solve the problem more systematically.
- **Check your answer.** Make sure your answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

**Practice Problems**

1. What is the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of 52 cards?
2. If you flip a coin three times, what is the probability of getting at least two heads?
3. A box contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. If you draw two balls without replacement, what is the probability that both balls are the same color?
4. A circle is inscribed in a square. What is the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square will also be inside the circle?

I hope these notes help you prepare for the probability section of the SAT math!
