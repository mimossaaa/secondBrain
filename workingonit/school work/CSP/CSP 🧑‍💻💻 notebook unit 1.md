	bit
		A bit, which is short for "binary digit", is the smallest form of data on a computer. Bits can only be 1 or 0. If a bit is 1, then it is "on" or true. And if a bit is off, then it is "off", or false
	byte
		a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit.
	overflow error
		when a number system is limited to a max number based on how many bits. 
		ex : a 
	roundoff
		when a number system cannot represent certain numbers such as decimals, and must round them.

Here are some notes on the four terms related to intellectual property and creative work:

### 1. Copyright
- **Definition**: Copyright is a legal right granted to the creator of an original work, such as literature, music, art, software, etc. It gives the creator exclusive rights to use, distribute, and modify their work.
- **Registration**: While copyright is automatically granted upon creation in many countries, registering with the Copyright Office provides legal advantages, like the ability to sue for infringement.
- **Usage by Others**: Others must obtain permission from the copyright holder to use, distribute, or adapt the work, except under certain exceptions like fair use.

### 2. Public Domain
- **Definition**: Works in the public domain are not protected by copyright law, meaning anyone can use, distribute, or modify them without asking for permission.
- **How It Happens**: A work may enter the public domain if it was never copyrighted, the copyright has expired, or the creator has explicitly released it into the public domain.

### 3. Fair Use
- **Definition**: Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission, primarily for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, and research.
- **Factors Determining Fair Use**: The purpose of use (commercial or educational), the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used in relation to the whole work, and the effect on the work's market value are considered to determine fair use.

### 4. Creative Commons
- **Definition**: Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization that offers free licenses for creators to use, allowing them to grant permission for others to use their work under specific conditions.
- **License Types**: There are several types of CC licenses, ranging from the most permissive (CC BY) to more restrictive (CC BY-NC-ND), depending on how much the creator wants to allow others to share, adapt, or use their work commercially. 

These concepts are fundamental for understanding how intellectual property rights work and how creators and users of content can navigate legal and ethical considerations in sharing and using creative works.

I think creative commons can help because it aloows people to share their work
i think copyright is good because it allows people to protect their work
it also allows people to save their good idea. It sucks when people steal that

what was digitized?
	2millys dance
who benefited?
	epic games benefited from selling the emote
who harmed?
	no one, but 2milly didn't get money
intended or unintended
	e
is copyright food or bad
	the original work can be stolen and used for financial gain
	-
	The accusation that Fortnite has been appropriating black music and dance culture for financial gain has been simmering for months, sparking debate over whether Fortnite has unfairly rebranded the popular dances as “#fortnitedances” while the creators don’t share any of the profits.

	creator is not compensated
	some laws are murky which prevent 2millys ability to get his

**how computers help process data**


- **Cleaning**
  - What it is: The process of correcting or removing inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data from a dataset.
  - What it does: Improves the quality and accuracy of data, making it more reliable for analysis.

- **Filtering**
  - What it is: The process of selectively choosing certain data points based on specific criteria.
  - What it does: Reduces the dataset to only the relevant information, improving focus and efficiency in analysis.

- **Classifying**
  - What it is: Organizing data into predefined categories or groups based on shared characteristics.
  - What it does: Helps in identifying patterns and trends, making data easier to analyze and interpret.

- **Bias**
  - What it is: A systematic error in data collection or analysis that leads to skewed or unfair results.
  - What it does: Can distort findings and lead to incorrect conclusions, so it’s important to identify and mitigate it.

- **Patterns**
  - What it is: Regular or predictable sequences and trends found within a dataset.
  - What it does: Helps in identifying relationships and making predictions based on historical data.

- **Correlations**
  - What it is: A statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other.
  - What it does: Helps in understanding the relationships between different data points and can indicate cause and effect.

- **Scalability**
  - What it is: The ability of a system or process to handle growing amounts of data or complexity.
  - What it does: Ensures that solutions can be efficiently expanded to meet increasing demands without loss of performance.

I'm working on an assignment for my AP computer science principles, and am stuck on this question

what is the amount of data compression an algorithm can produce reliant upon?

1-no repeating parts of the file being compressed
2-several patterns in the data
3-large file size
4-small file size


Please help


I'm working on an assignment for my AP computer science principles, and am stuck on this question

what is one way in which number systems are abstract?

1-the same amount can be represented by differernt number representations
2-a number can only be represented by one number system
3-symbos cannot be used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide them in their abstract form
4-the use constants


Please help

- **Computing Device:**  
  A machine that can run a program, including computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.

- **Computing System:**  
  A group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.

- **Computing Network:**  
  A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.

- **Path:**  
  The series of connections between computing devices on a network, starting with a sender and ending with a receiver.

- **Bandwidth:**  
  The maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time, usually measured in bits per second.

tolerance
fault tolerance
redundancy
routing


Router: A type of computer that forwards data across a network

Redundancy:  the inclusion of extra components so that a system can continue to work even if individual components fail, for example by  having more than one path between any two connected devices in a network.

Fault Tolerant:  Can continue to function even in the event of individual component failures. This is important because elements of complex systems like a computer network fail at unexpected times, often in groups.

	FAST
	mainly used for sending packets fast
	used for streaming
TCP
	useful for accuracy

IP adress
	different wifis give different ips

How does DNS help the internet scale?
	seperates things into domains, and we can acsess domains to udnerstand what's in the domain

HTTP
	hyper text transfer protocol
HTML
	hyper text makeup lamguage
		modify text size n font

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): 
	a protocol for computers to request and share the pages that make up the world wide web on the Internet
The Domain Name System (DNS):
	the system responsible for translating domain names like example.com into IP addresses
Scalability:
	the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands
World Wide Web: 
	a system of linked pages, programs, and files

The World Wide Web is different from the Internet. The World Wide Web are files, web pages and media. The Internet is the network we use to access those files.

The DNS is an important system in helping the Internet scale.
