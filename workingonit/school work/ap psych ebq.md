- **A. Propose a specific and defensible claim based in psychological science that responds to the question:**  
  - The best time for school to start for students in grades 6 to 12 is after 8:30 AM because getting adequate sleep improves memory consolidation, motor skills, and cognitive functioning, all of which are critical for learning and academic performance. Research shows that sleep, including naps and REM sleep, supports better retention of information and skill acquisition, which is necessary for students to succeed in school.

- **B. (i) Support your claim using at least one piece of specific and relevant evidence from one of the sources:**  
  - Source 2 provides evidence supporting the claim that sleep enhances the ability to learn complex motor skills. In this study, participants who took a 2-hour nap after practicing juggling were able to catch more balls in a retest than those who did not nap, demonstrating that sleep improves the retention and performance of new skills.

---

- **B. (ii) Explain how the evidence from Part B (i) supports your claim using a psychological perspective, theory, concept, or research finding learned in AP Psychology:**  
  - The evidence from Source 2 supports the psychological concept of **memory consolidation**, specifically how sleep, particularly napping, helps consolidate motor skills learned during wakefulness. This is consistent with research in cognitive psychology that shows how procedural memory, the type involved in skills like juggling, is strengthened by sleep. Allowing students more time to sleep by starting school later can improve their ability to retain and apply newly learned skills, which is critical for academic performance across various subjects that require practice and motor learning.

- **C. (i) Support your claim using an additional piece of specific and relevant evidence from a different source than the one that was used in Part B (i):**  
  - Source 1 provides evidence that sleep also enhances language development. In a study of two-year-olds learning new verbs, children who took a nap after learning showed better retention of the words than those who stayed awake. This suggests that sleep not only improves motor skills but also facilitates language acquisition and memory retention, which are essential for academic success in older students.

- **C. (ii) Explain how the evidence from Part C (i) supports your claim using a different psychological perspective, theory, concept, or research finding learned in AP Psychology than the one that was used in Part B (ii):**  
  - The evidence from Source 1 aligns with the **information processing theory**, which emphasizes the role of sleep in organizing and storing information. Sleep allows the brain to process complex information, such as language, into long-term memory. For students in grades 6 to 12, acquiring and retaining new vocabulary and concepts is crucial for learning. By starting school later and allowing more time for sleep, students’ cognitive abilities, particularly in language and information retention, would improve, supporting overall academic achievement.

I'm a senior in high school taking ap psychology. I have the following 3 sources, along with an image of a graph for you to analyze. I want you to analyze these sources, and answer the following questions.

**Questions**

**This question has three parts: Part A, Part B, and Part C. Use the three sources provided to answer all parts of the question. 

For Part B and Part C, you must cite the source that you used to answer the question. You can do this in two different ways:  

▪ Parenthetical Citation:  

For example: “...(Source A)” 

▪ Embedded Citation: 

For example: “According to Source A,...” 
  
Write the response to each part of the question in complete sentences. Use appropriate psychological terminology. 

Using the sources provided, develop and justify an argument about the best time for school to start for students in grades 6 to 12.**

**A.  Propose a specific and defensible claim based in psychological science that responds to the question.**

**B. (i) Support your claim using at least one piece of specific and relevant evidence from one of the sources.**

 **B. (ii) Explain how the evidence from Part B (i) supports your claim using a psychological perspective,   theory, concept, or research finding learned in AP Psychology.**

**C. (i) Support your claim using an additional piece of specific and relevant evidence from a different source than the one that was used in Part B (i).**

  **C. (ii) Explain how the evidence from Part C (i) supports your claim using a  different psychological perspective, theory, concept, or research finding learned in AP Psychology than the one that was used in Part B (ii).**

I want you to answer the following questions in this format:

**A.  Propose a specific and defensible claim based in psychological science that responds to the question.**
	(answer to question A)
  **C. (ii) Explain how the evidence from Part C (i) supports your claim using a  different psychological perspective, theory, concept, or research finding learned in AP Psychology than the one that was used in Part B (ii).**
	  (answer to question c(ii))

	Introduction
		 Sleep improves memory consolidation, but little research has been conducted on the role of sleep in helping children learn different types of words. Much of the past research has focused on how sleep improves the learning of nouns, but few studies have investigated how sleep improves children's learning of verbs, which tend to be more complex.  
	Participants 
		The participants consisted of 42 two-year-olds. All children were developing typically and only spoke English.
	Method
		Two-year-olds were presented with new verbs, and researchers tested their knowledge of the words immediately after presentation. Then, some children were randomly assigned to stay awake for 4 hours, while other children were randomly assigned to take a 4-hour nap. After this 4-hour period, the children's memory of the verbs was retested.
	Results and Discussion
		The children who had napped demonstrated greater retention of the verbs than the children who stayed awake. This study allowed research to conclude that sleep directly affects children's language development.

	Introduction 
		Because learning complex, coordinated motor skills such as juggling 3 balls involves explicit memory, researchers wondered whether learning such a motor skill would be improved with sleep.
	Participants 
		Sixteen female college students participated in the study. 
	Method 
		Researchers had participants practice juggling in the morning and tested their skill by measuring how many balls they caught. The researchers then randomly assigned 8 of the participants to take a 2-hour nap after practice (the nap group), while the other 8 stayed awake (the control group). They retested juggling skill after that 2-hour period.
	Graph
		the graph shows that the mean number of catches of the nap group surprasses the control group in the retest, but not in the test

**Source 3**
	The authors reviewed the decades of scientific evidence related to rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is associated with dreaming and with "wake-like" brain activity. People tend to experience more REM sleep after they have engaged in procedural memory tasks and declarative memory tasks that involve complex or emotional information. When people go without REM sleep, they tend to have difficulty with recall. There may be some connection with REM sleep and memory problems associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease.
