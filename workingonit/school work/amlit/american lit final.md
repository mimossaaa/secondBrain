	Like a young god. Hercules—something like that. And the sun, the sun all around him. Remember how he waved to me? Right up from the field, with the representatives of three colleges standing by? And the buyers I brought, and the cheers when he came out—Loman! Loman! Loman! God Almighty, he’ll be great yet. A star like that, magnificent, can never really fade away.
