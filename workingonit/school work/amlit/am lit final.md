What is the final lesson of Fools Crow? How did Fast Horse’s role as White Man’s Dog/Fools Crow’s character foil help to show that final message? Use specific examples and quotes from the text to support your assertions.  

  

The final lesson of fools crow is the importance of community. The story shows this through two characters, White man's dog and fast horse. While having a good community helps white man's dog better himself and his life, Fast horse's rejection and lack of community makes him lose many things.

  

White man's dog starts as a character who is isolated from the community and lacking in many aspects. However, he is repeatedly helped by his community to overcome these flaws. The first example is towards the beginning of the story when he was helped by his best friend, Fast horse. Fast horse introduced him to Yellow Kidney and helped him join a party to raid a nearby village INSERT QUOTE HERE. Fast Horse knew that WMD was very unconfident and fearful, and invited him to the raid to help him overcome that. Despite being one of the first events in the story, this very well shows the lesson of the importance of community. In this case, having a good community and friends helped WMD overcome his fears and gain confidence. Being a good friend and member of his community, FH knew his flaws and wanted to help him overcome them by bringing him on this trip. The event explains that having a good community can help you overcome your flaws and shortcomings. Towards the end of the story, WMD becomes possessed by an evil spirit. However, to his benefit, one member of his community was a medicine man. This man, called Mikapi, was also his mentor and teacher and a very close member of his community. Mikapi conducted a ritual to dispel this evil spirit from WMD.ENTER QUOTE HERE This story again reflects the final lesson of the story, which is the importance of community. It specifically shows the benefits of being part of a larger community. When in a larger community, there will be all sorts of people with different talents and skills who can help you overcome all kinds of challenges, even obscure ones like being possessed by an evil spirit.

  
  

What is the Hero’s Journey Cycle archetype? How and why does the novel Fools Crow use it as the central structure for its story? Use specific examples and quotes from the text to support your assertions.

  

The Hero's Journey Cycle archetype is a framework for a first person story. It is a story made up of 12 parts, which take place in two worlds, the ordinary and special world. Those 12 parts can be grouped into three acts, separation, supreme ordeal, and unification. The Hero's Journey Cycle is often used in mainstream media, with popular examples being the Men In Black, The Matrix, and Moana. The 12 parts of the Hero's Journey Cycle are as follows, call to adventure, refusal of call, supernatural aid/ Mentor, crossing the threshold, new allies and enemies, ordeal, death of the mentor, battle with the brother, temptation, road back, refusal to return, ultimate reward, master of two worlds.

  

The Hero's Journey Cycle is also used in the story of Fool's Crow. The story starts out with WMD being invited to raid a neighboring village by FH. INSERT QUOTE HERE this is the first step of the Hero's Journey Cycle, the call to adventure. However, soon after WMD doubts himself and rejects FH's offer INSERT QUOTE HERE. Which is the refusal of the call, which is the second part of the Hero's Journey Cycle. After this he meets his mentor, YK, and ends up departing on the raid and faces challenges, ADD EVIDENCE INSERT QUOTE HERE. These events make up the next few parts of Hero's Journey cycle, the mentor, and new allies and enemies. After this, the big ordeal happens when the raid finally occurs, and it doesn't go 100% right. This leads us to the next part of the Hero's journey cycle, the death of a mentor. After the raid ends, YK is nowhere to be seen, and the whole raid party believes him to be dead INSERT QUOTE HERE.  After this, WMD returns to the village, and has a new duty. He decides to help support the family of his past mentor, Yellow kidney. He goes to hunt every day and leaves his game at the front of the house of Heavy shield woman, Yellow kidney's wife. At this time, WMD again decides that he must support the family of his former mentor. He approaches FH about a former dream in which he made a deal with Cold Maker. Unfortunately, Fast horse didn't fulfill his part of the agreement, and WMD thought this was what made Yellow kidney disappear INSERT QUOTE HERE.  WMD very kindly approaches FH, asking to help him fulfill his deal, as he thought it was why YK disappeared. However, despite WMD's kind approach, FH angrily pushes WMD away, and rejects the offer. These events are the battle with brother and temptation parts of the story.  Then the story goes on to give wmd the

Social constructs are concepts that aren't real, but made up by humans,  and they have shaped all of modern American society. A very very important social construct to understand is race, which has shaped American society drastically. Humans are one of the species with the smallest genetic diversity. Race was created without basis on any scientific data, but on emotions of hatred, and a desire to preserve the best for the whitest. It has created the hierarchical system which has crushed dreams of Americans of color while giving white Americans various privileges. Although not having been specifically created in America, due to the transatlantic slave trade, a new version of Race and racism has arose in america. The American version of race has even been exported out of America in two ways. One, through other racist governments directly copying American racist systems. One example of this is in Nazi Germany, where the Nazis adopted racist Jim Crow policies into their racist laws against jews. This is shown in how the american laws of making asian americans non citizens were adopted into the citizenship portion of the nazi nuremberg laws. Understanding how race is an important social construct is very important as it is one of the founding social constructs to our nation. The social construct of race was created in order to justify slavery. Slavery was used
