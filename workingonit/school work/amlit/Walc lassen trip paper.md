Here are some key bullet points on glacial erratics for your paper:

- **Definition**: Glacial erratics are large rocks or boulders that were transported and deposited by glaciers, often far from their original location.
- **Movement**: As glaciers move, they pick up rocks from one area and carry them over long distances before depositing them in a new location.
- **Size and shape**: Erratics can vary in size, from small pebbles to massive boulders, and they often stand out because they don't match the surrounding rock types.
- **Significance**: They provide evidence of past glacial movement and help scientists understand the extent and direction of glacier flow.
- **Geology**: The composition of glacial erratics usually differs from the local geology, indicating they originated from a different source area, often many miles away.
- **Examples in Lassen National Park**: In Lassen, erratics can be found where glaciers from ancient volcanic peaks transported rocks and deposited them as they melted.
- **Study importance**: Geologists study erratics to track the historical path of glaciers and learn more about Earth's climate history during ice ages.

You can elaborate on these points and relate them to Lassen National Park’s geology and glacial history!

**Description of the Image (Lava Rock Formation, Lassen Volcanic National Park):**

- The image shows a large, rugged pile of dark volcanic rock, likely basalt, in the foreground.
- The rock is jagged and sharp, with an uneven, blocky texture, indicative of cooled lava flows.
- In contrast, the background contains a forest of tall evergreen trees, highlighting the boundary between the volcanic rock and the natural vegetation.
- The terrain around the lava rock formation appears barren, with minimal vegetation, indicating the difficulty plants face in establishing themselves on the rocky, nutrient-poor surface.
- The lighting is bright, with clear skies, emphasizing the sharp shadows cast by the rough volcanic surface.
- The location showcases a lava field or flow, typical of Lassen’s volcanic landscape.

**Geological Interpretation:**

- The dark volcanic rock is likely basalt, formed from the rapid cooling of lava after an eruption. The jagged, sharp texture suggests it is a type of a’a lava, known for its rough and clinkery surface.
- The lava flow visible in the image was likely created by an eruption in Lassen’s volcanic history, where molten rock flowed out, cooled, and solidified into the blocky formation seen here.
- The minimal vegetation surrounding the lava rocks reflects the early stage of ecological succession, where life slowly begins to colonize the nutrient-poor volcanic soil.
- Tectonic activity beneath Lassen Volcanic National Park has contributed to this formation, as molten magma rises to the surface and erupts, creating lava fields like the one seen here.
- The evergreen forest in the background demonstrates how the landscape transitions from barren volcanic rock to a more established ecosystem over time, illustrating the gradual recovery after volcanic activity.


**lava beds explanation - description**
	The Cinder Cone volcano sits on the eastern side of LVNP and is one of the four types of volcanoes inside the park boundaries. Cinder cone rose over 700 feet out of the ground and sprayed ash over an area of 30 square miles. In 1650 two large basaltic lava flows seeped out of the base of the volcano, devouring everything in its path, damming creeks, and creating the two lakes. Snag lake to the southeast, and Butte lake to the north. This outpouring of lava is known as the Fantastic Lava Beds, and is a premier destination for visitors to the park. (the views from the top of Cinder Cone are quite spectacular).


Sure, here's a rewritten interpretation:

**Basaltic Lava Flows**  
The majority of lava flows, including those from Kīlauea and Mauna Loa in Hawai’i, are composed of basalt, a type of lava with low silica content. This makes the lava highly fluid, allowing it to flow easily across large areas. Basaltic lava flows are common in shield volcanoes like those in Hawai’i, fissure volcanoes such as Craters of the Moon in Idaho, and other volcanic formations. These flows can be categorized into two main types: *pāhoehoe*, which has a smooth or ropy surface, and *‘a‘ā*, which is rough and clinkery. 

**Flow Dynamics**  
Basaltic lava flows typically occur in effusive eruptions where the lava either oozes from vents or is ejected in lava fountains. The speed and distance that lava can travel depend on the discharge rate and topography. Faster, high-discharge eruptions usually result in lava covering more ground.

**Types of Lava Flows**  
Lava flows can occur as broad sheets, within channels, or through lava tubes. *Sheet-fed lava flows* are continuous masses of lava that form during high-volume eruptions and often on gentle slopes. *Channel-fed flows* develop when lava moves through surface channels formed by the cooling of the lava’s edges, while *tube-fed flows* occur when lava moves through conduits beneath the surface, insulated from the cooler outer layers.

**Notable Features**  
Basaltic lava flows exhibit several unique surface features. *Breakouts* are new lava flows that emerge from the molten interior of existing flows. *Lava flow fields* are regions formed by one or more lava flows during a single eruption. Additionally, basaltic flows may create structures like *lava tubes*, *kipukas* (islands of older land surrounded by newer lava), *pillow basalts* (formed during underwater eruptions), and tree mold fossils.

Each of these features provides insight into the flow’s behavior, eruption conditions, and the surrounding environment. These basaltic lava flows are present in national parks across the U.S., offering valuable geological diversity for researchers and visitors alike.

Bumpass Hell formed as a result of volcanic activity associated with the ancient Mount Tehama, a massive stratovolcano that once stood in Lassen Volcanic National Park. When Mount Tehama collapsed millions of years ago, it left behind a caldera, which now hosts various geothermal areas, including Bumpass Hell. This area spans 16 acres and is characterized by hot springs, fumaroles, and boiling mudpots, which are remnants of the geothermal activity beneath the surface.

Bumpass Hell's geothermal features are driven by fissures that tap into volcanic heat from a cooling mass of andesite rock, located about three miles below the surface. These fissures allow volcanic gases and heated water to rise to the surface, creating the boiling pools, mudpots, and steam vents seen today. The water temperature at Bumpass Hell can reach as high as 198°F (92°C), and gases such as steam and carbon dioxide, along with sulfur, contribute to the chemical reactions that alter the surrounding rocks. These reactions produce colorful clays and minerals like sulfur, pyrite, and kaolin.

The hydrothermal activity in Bumpass Hell is part of a larger system of geothermal features scattered across the former Mount Tehama's caldera, which includes other prominent geothermal areas like Sulphur Works, Boiling Springs Lake, and Devil's Kitchen. The distinctive rotten-egg smell from hydrogen sulfide is a hallmark of such areas, indicating the presence of volcanic gases reacting with the surrounding environment.

Over time, Bumpass Hell has become one of the most prominent and visually striking geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park, offering a glimpse into the volcanic forces that shaped the region millions of years ago.

The image shows a huge rounded rock balancing on the edge of a cliff. The rock is the image's subject, with rolling mountains covered with dense forests under a blue sky in the background. The boulder seems to be composed of a rough, weathered rock with an uneven surface. It also appears to have some patches of lichen upon it. The rock seems to be granite, or some hard igneous rock, common in mountain regions. The rock has a slightly bulbous shape, along with green lichen skin. 

It seems that this rock was formed from a glacier formation. Huge glaciers once possessed tons of area, with their frozen bodies of water. As temperatures changed, they melted and started to move. Everything that was on and in them moved with them too, and these huge masses destroyed everything in their path. This is called a glacial erratic, which is a large rock or boulder that was transported and deposited by glaciers far from its original location. The composition of these glacial erratics is usually very different from the local geology, which indicates they originated from a different source area. Specific to Lassen, erratics can be found where glaciers from ancient volcanic peaks transported rocks and deposited them as they melted. These erratics are very important, as geologists can study them to track the path of glaciers, learning more about the earth's climate history during ice ages.




To be honest, I am utterly disappointed with this trip. The positive walk experiences I had last year which I shared with my peer inspired him to join. However, it seemed this trip was not a good start to his WALC journey. He has been my friend for a long time, and I deeply care about him. It makes me feel sad that the WALC I told him about is not the one he is now experiencing. Personally, unlike the other trips, the lessons were shockingly uninteresting. It was the same experience I had in class with the boring lectures. I felt like we were wasting time with uninteresting lessons that were crafted to feel like lectures despite being right beside the phenomenon we were studying. The trip felt like a long lecture, rather than an excursion or field study it could've been. The hiking was very slow and weak, and I lost the taste for food in the last few days. However, since I was showing my peer WALC for the first time, I tried to stay hopeful and positive, making things seem good. Something that particularly upset me was a comment from Mr.Gonzales. Both Mr.G and Mr.B complained about my overly testosterone behavior and bro culture. It was extremely insulting when Mr.G called me a Stanford frat boy. To explain my disdain for this comment, I think it is important to first explain what a Stanford frat boy is. They are alcoholics, drug addicts, serial rapists, and white suburban kids who are from millionaire families. The People v. Turner case is a perfect example of this. A Stanford fratboy raped a woman when she was unconscious after attending a frat party. Records also show his extensive drug use, from LSD, ecstasy, and marijuana. The fact that Mr.G called me a drug-addicted rapist in the middle of the trip was deeply off-putting and set me in a horrible mood for the rest of the trip. Despite these complaints, I am deeply grateful to the teachers who organized and participated in this trip. I was able to experience the Lassen Volcanic Park, and for that, will be forever grateful.




This image shows Bumpass hell, a hydrothermal area. It has several pools of discolored water, bubbling due to volcanic activity beneath it. The area is decorated with rocky debris, mostly white and light-colored. Rising steam is shown in the background, which seems to be steam vents. The pool seems to be many meters wide, and the rocky surrounding is much larger, stretching into the background. It seems very steamy, sulfuric, and rugged. Removing the trees would prompt someone to wonder if this is on Earth, due to the otherworldly aura it possesses.

This geothermal phenomenon is a result of tectonic and volcanic forces. Lassen Peak is part of the Ring of Fire, and the subduction of the oceanic plate beneath the continental crust drives the volcanic activity in the region. Bumpass Hell formed due to deep magmatic heat. Groundwater seeps down into the Earth's crust, where it is heated by the cooling andesite rock mass beneath the surface, then returns as steam and hot water. The steamy, sulfur-rich atmosphere gives the area its characteristic rotten-egg smell, caused by hydrogen sulfide gas. The formation of Bumpass Hell is influenced by both tectonic forces from the subduction zone, which heats the groundwater, and gravitational forces that shape the landscape and the movement of water.



















In this image, we can observe a group of students sitting near a large rocky outcrop, observing and taking notes during a field lesson. The rocks are very jagged, scattered across the landscape, and seem to be light-colored volcanic rocks. They have sharp and uneven surfaces indicating some sort of weathering, and sparse vegetation such as trees and shrubs grow within the crevices. The mountain slips upward with the boulders stacked unevenly. Overall, it seems like an educational landscape, with students studying the volcanic landscape, while taking notes.

This rocky outcrop most likely formed from past volcanic eruptions, made of rocks that fell from volcanoes. The angular fragmented rocks seem to indicate a physical weathering process, like freeze and thaw cycles in high-altitude areas. As volcanoes spat out huge chunks of lava at the peak of these mountains, gravity pulled them down. While they were sliding down the hill, they slammed into trees, rocks, and boulders. These collisions wore down on the stones, and when they lay to rest, were only fragments of what they once were. These are what we see within the trees and bushes, pieces of once huge rocks broken down.










This image depicts a large rugged pile of dark volcanic rock in the foreground. The rocks are sharp and jagged with blocky uneven texture, indicating cooled lava flows. Contrasting the dark rocks, the background shows a forest of tall evergreen trees, showing the boundary between the volcanic rock and the natural vegetation. The terrain around the lava rocks seems to be plain and barren, with little vegetation, indicating the difficulty for plants to establish themselves in this biome. The skies in the image are clear, bringing bright lighting around the image.

In this image, we can see dark volcanic rock, most likely basalt formed from the rapid cooling of lava after an eruption. This lava is composed of low silica content, making the lava highly fluid, and allowing it to flow easily across large areas, such as across a long lake in Lassen Park. They often form from shield volcanoes or cinder cones, like the one we climbed up on the first day. This creates large volumes of rock above the earth, made of basalt. These naturally break down, by gravitational forces like weathering. Weathering forces come in many different forms, such as mechanical weathering, which is when a physical force causes the rock to disintegrate. This can be frost disintegration, which happens when water makes its way into existing cracks in the rock. When it freezes in the winter, it expands, enlarging the crack with it. Another form of weathering is wind root pressure. This occurs when roots from plants decay the rock, as roots expand into cracks, they exert pressure on the rock, eventually breaking them. These two forms of weathering are most likely great factors in decreasing the once huge lava flow into this pile of rocks and boulders. The large lake (although hot in the image, it is right behind the pile), is an indicator that water would have likely rained down on the rocks, and the trees in the background serve as evidence root pressure was likely present. To conclude, I can imagine a huge flow of lava being released from the cinder cone, which landed throughout the area. Through years of weathering, this once huge flow was decreased into smaller rocks and boulders through many different forms of weathering.
