### ASTRONOMY

Here are three bullet points describing each of the Earth's spheres:

### Atmosphere
- The layer of gases surrounding Earth, primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%).
- Protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature.
- Plays a critical role in weather patterns, climate, and sustaining life by providing breathable air.

### Biosphere
- Encompasses all living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.
- Interacts with other spheres through processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition.
- Supports biodiversity and ecosystems, which are vital for maintaining ecological balance.

### Hydrosphere
- Consists of all water on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and glaciers.
- Covers about 71% of Earth's surface, with the majority being saltwater in oceans.
- Essential for all forms of life and plays a key role in weather and climate through the water cycle.

### Geosphere
- Includes all solid parts of the Earth, such as rocks, minerals, soil, and the core, mantle, and crust.
- Provides natural resources like minerals, fossil fuels, and soil for plants.
- Influences landscapes and natural events like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain formation.

These points should help you with your notes in Environmental Science!
