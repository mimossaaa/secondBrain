optics
	study of light and behavior and properties of light
light rays
	a ray is a idealized geometric model of light
	line that is perpendicular to the wavefronts of the actual light and points in the direction of energy flow
sources of light
	lightbulbs
	pencil
		reflects light
emission
	stars
reflection
	light bouncing off a surface which started from a source like a lightbulb
refraction
	light rays bend because they slow down through optically more dense materials than air
index of refraction
	water = 1.33
	air = 1.00
	pyrex = 1.47
	veggie oil = 1.47
