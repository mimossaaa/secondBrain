1. Provide background information on the mission, science, and/or scientist. What was understood and not understood in astronomy at the time this mission/ research was done? Who was involved in this project?
	1. space telescope
	2. The objective was to study the universe in infrared
	3. designed and managed by NASA/JPL-Caltech
	4. launched Aug. 25, 2003 / 05:35:39 UT
	5. CfA astrophysicist Giovanni Fazio led the team that built the main infared camera
	6. named in honor of Lyman Spitzer who made the idea of orbiting observatories
	7. 
2. What was the purpose of the mission and/or experiment? What were scientists trying to figure out?
	1. the purpose of the mission was to get infared images of the universe from the irac, the main infared camera
3. What was the technology behind the research and/or spacecraft and what did the spacecraft look like?
	1. many of the frames were made with berrylium due to its thermochemical qualitites
		1. it has an extremley low heat capacity at low temperatures so it can cool down quickly
	2. 
4. Provide the details of the mission/ study. How long did it take? What was the spacecraftâ€™s path in space? How much did it cost? Where was it launched? What problems did the spacecraft or scientist encounter?
	1. it cost 720 million
	2. launched at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station
	3. the telsecope ran out of the cooling heluium 6 years after launch
	4. orbits the sun  in the same way earth does
5. What was the data collected from the mission/ study?
	1. seeing light from the earliest objects in the universe
	2. finding a new ring around saturn
	3. finding water vapor on an exoplanet
	4. mapping weather on a expolanet
6. Was the mission/ study successful? Why or why not? What did astronomers learn or conclude from the mission/ study? Describe more than one conclusion and use IMAGES from the actual spacecraft.
	1. yes, as it lasted much longer than the predicted time
7. How does your topic relate to what you have learned in astronomy?
	1. Infared imaging led to the ability to better categorize asteroids
		1. when asteroids are heated up by the sun, they release a faint infared 
8. If you had to choose the most important thing that your classmates should learn from the study, what would it be?
	1. The importance of imfared images
		1. Infrared waves have longer wavelengths than visible light and can pass through dense regions of gas and dust in space with less scattering and absorption. Thus, infrared energy can also reveal objects in the universe that cannot be seen in visible light using optical telescopes.
