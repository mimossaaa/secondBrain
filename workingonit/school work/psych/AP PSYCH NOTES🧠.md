**==research methods in psychology==**
	descriptive research
		Research aimed at observing and describing behavior without manipulating variables.
	case study
			Detailed analysis of a single subject or small group.
		naturalistic observation
			Observing subjects in their natural environment without interference.
		survey
			Collecting data from a large group using questionnaires or interviews.
	correlational research
		Examines relationships between variables to identify patterns or associations.
	experiment
	longitudinal
		Research studying the same subjects over a long period to observe changes.
	cross sectional
		Research comparing different age groups or cohorts at a single point in time.
**==elements of research==**
	theory
		A well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the world based on evidence.
	hypothesis
		A testable prediction about the relationship between variables.
	replication
		Repeating a study to verify its findings and confirm results.
	population
		The entire group of individuals that researchers are interested in studying.
	random sample
		A subset of the population selected randomly to represent the whole.
	operational definition
		Specific explanation of abstract concepts or variables used in a study.
	random selection
		Process of choosing participants from a population by chance.
	The Experimental Method 
	Experimental Group
		Group exposed to the independent variable in awn experiment.
	Control Group 
	Independent Variable 
	Dependent Variable 
	Confounding Variable 
		An extraneous factor that affects the dependent variable, skewing results.
	Double Blind Study 
		Study where neither participants nor researchers know who is receiving the treatment.
	Placebo Effect 
		Improvement due to the belief that one is receiving treatment, not the treatment itself.
	Random Assignment


**==Statistical Analysis in Psychology==**
	Descriptive Statistics 
		Statistical methods used to summarize, organize, and simplify data.
	Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) 
		Indicate the center of a data set: Mean, Median, Mode.
	Variance (Range & Std. Deviation) 
		Measure of data spread; includes range and standard deviation.
	Frequency Distribution (normal, bimodal, positive skew,   negative skew)
		Shows how often each value in a data set occurs.
	Inferential Statistics 
		Methods that use sample data to make generalizations about a population.
		Statistical Significance (P-value and t-Tests) 
			Indicates whether results are likely due to chance (p-value < 0.05).
	Scatterplot
		A graph showing the relationship between two quantitative variables.
	Correlational Coefficient
		A statistical measure (r) that indicates the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.

==**Early approaches**==
	Structuralism
		Early psychology school focused on breaking down mental processes into basic components.
		what is the structure of the brain?
			Example: A researcher asks participants to describe their sensations and thoughts while looking at an apple, focusing on its color, shape, and texture to break down their experience into basic sensory components.
	Functionalism
		Examines how mental and behavioral processes function to help individuals adapt to environments.
		what is the function of the brain?
			Example: Studying how memory helps students solve problems and retain information to perform well in different learning environments.
	Behaviorism
		Focuses on observable behaviors and the role of learning through interactions with the environment.
			Example: B.F. Skinner’s experiments with pigeons where he used reinforcement to teach them specific behaviors, like pecking a button to receive food (operant conditioning).
	Psychoanalytic/psychodynamic
		Emphasizes unconscious processes and childhood experiences in shaping behavior and personality.
			Example: A therapist explores a client's early childhood experiences and unconscious feelings to understand the root cause of their current anxiety or phobias.
	Gestalt
		Focuses on how people perceive and experience objects as whole patterns rather than as separate parts.
			Example: The "phi phenomenon" where we perceive a series of still images in rapid succession as continuous motion, as seen in flipbooks or movies, illustrating how our mind fills in gaps to create a coherent picture.



==**Modern approaches**==
	Biological
		Examines how brain structures, neurotransmitters, and genetics influence behavior and mental processes.
	Behavioral
		Focuses on observable behaviors and how they are learned through conditioning and reinforcement.
	Evolutionary
		Explores how natural selection and adaptation influence behaviors and mental traits.
	Cognitive
		Studies mental processes like perception, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making.
		Cognitive psychology, also known as brain science, is the study of how the human brain works and how people think, learn, and remember.
	Psychodynamic
		Focuses on unconscious drives, conflicts, and early childhood experiences influencing behavior.
	Humanistic
		Emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and free will as key components of human behavior.
	Sociocultural
		Examines how cultural, social, and environmental factors impact behavior and mental processes.
	Biopsychosocial
		Integrates biological, psychological, and social factors in understanding health, behavior, and mental processes.


==TERMS TO REVIEW FROM TEST==
	quasi experiment
		a research method that assesses the impact of an intervention on a target population without random assignment.

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbfhRKENScw) notes
	psychodynamic - psychoanalytic perspecitve
		freud
		uncnncious motives
		free association
			one word/image associates another
		-
		seeks to study hidden things - cannot actually be studied
	behavioral - response to psychodynamic
		psychology should be objective that focuses on studying observable behaviors wout referencing the metnal processes.
		uses reinforcement and punishment
		mmodifying behavior
	sociocultural
		how cultural noms guide behavor in a group
		can be difficult to measure
		provides insight on different behaviors across cultures
	humanistic - response to behavioral
		emphasizes potential to grow of humans
		focuses on free well
		maslov
		used in therapy
	cognitive
		how we interpret process and remember information 
		focuses on inner thoughts
		how this effects behavori
		this is impossible
		cbt - cognigive behaviroal therapy
	bilogival
		allows us to understand mental disorers, different neurological conditions, and effects of medicine on brain
	bio psychosocual
		combination
	evolutionary
		how adaptation effects behavior

**Neural firing**

What does it mean that an axon membrane is selectively permeable?
	The membrane contains voltage gated ion channels that either open to allow ion exchange (depolarization) or close to prevent ion exchange (polarization).
Neural Firing
	▪ Action Potential
	▪ a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon
	 Also called neural impulse or nerve firing or depolarization
	▪ generated by the movement of positively charged ions into the axon.
	▪ This process starts due to stimulation of the receptor sites for the neuron that is firing

**Polarization**
	the resting state of the neuron, charge is more positive outside the membrane and more negative inside.

**Depolarization**
	the action potential; the rushing in and out of positively charged ions.

**Repolarization** 
	the refractory period; the closing of the membrane and reestablishing a more negative charge inside

### Mouse party activity




- **Heroin**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Heroin binds to opioid receptors, causing an increase in dopamine release, leading to intense euphoria and pain relief.

- **Ecstasy (MDMA)**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Serotonin
  - **Action**: MDMA causes a large release of serotonin, as well as inhibiting its reuptake, leading to heightened mood, emotional closeness, and sensory perception.

- **Marijuana (THC)**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: THC binds to cannabinoid receptors, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters like GABA, which indirectly increases dopamine levels, causing relaxation and euphoria.

- **Methamphetamine**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Methamphetamine triggers the release of dopamine and blocks its reuptake, resulting in high levels of dopamine in the brain, producing intense euphoria and increased energy.

- **Alcohol**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: GABA and Glutamate
  - **Action**: Alcohol enhances the effects of GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) and reduces the activity of glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), leading to sedation and relaxation.

- **Cocaine**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, allowing it to accumulate in the synapse, producing intense euphoria and increased energy.

- **LSD**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Serotonin
  - **Action**: LSD binds to serotonin receptors, particularly in the visual cortex, altering perception and causing hallucinations.
