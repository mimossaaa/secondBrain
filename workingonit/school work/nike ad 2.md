1. What desire is the ad trying to create?

  

2. With whom? Who is the target audience? How do you know?

  

3.What is this brand encoding and promising to provide for the audience if they join its cult? How does it do so? 

- Does the ad encourage the audience to “follow the herd?” Why/why not? (see class notes) 
    
- Does this ad appeal to any of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? How so? (see class notes) 
    
- Which appeals and/or fallacies (see class notes) does it use? How so? 
    
- (this answer should be VERY detailed, and can use bullet points)
    

  
  

4. How is this similar or different from the more current ad campaign? What has the brand changed about what it encodes to its audience?**
