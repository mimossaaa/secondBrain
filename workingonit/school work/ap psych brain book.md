### **Page 7: Cerebellum**
- **Function**: The balance and movement coach! It helps you move smoothly and keep your balance.
- **Example**: When you ride a bike or do a cartwheel, your cerebellum helps you stay steady.
- **Fun Fact**: It’s like a mini-brain that helps you keep control of your body’s movements.

### **Page 9: Broca’s Area**
- **Function**: Your speech maker! It helps you talk and form words.
- **Example**: When you talk to your friends or sing, Broca’s area is making sure the words come out just right.
- **Fun Fact**: If Broca’s area gets hurt, you might have a hard time talking, even if you know what you want to say.
- **Illustration**: A brain with a megaphone saying “Hello!”

---

### **Page 10: Wernicke’s Area**
- **Function**: The word understander! It helps you understand what other people are saying to you.
- **Example**: When your teacher explains something in class, Wernicke’s area helps you understand the words.
- **Fun Fact**: Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area work together like teammates to help you talk and understand language!
- **Illustration**: Two brain characters talking to each other.

---

### **Page 11: Thalamus**
- **Function**: The information traffic controller! It sends messages from your body to the right part of your brain.
- **Example**: When you see, hear, or touch something, the thalamus sends the signal to the correct part of your brain to understand it.
- **Fun Fact**: The thalamus is like a switchboard, directing traffic in your brain!
- **Illustration**: A brain character directing traffic.

---

### **Page 12: Hippocampus**
- **Function**: The memory keeper! It helps you remember things, like what you did last summer or where you put your favorite toy.
- **Example**: When you study for a test or try to remember a new friend’s name, your hippocampus helps store those memories.
- **Fun Fact**: Without the hippocampus, you wouldn’t be able to make new memories!

---

### **Page 13: Hypothalamus**
- **Function**: The body temperature controller! It helps keep your body temperature just right and makes sure you're hungry or thirsty at the right times.
- **Example**: When you’re cold, your hypothalamus helps warm you up. If you’re thirsty, it tells you to drink water.
- **Fun Fact**: The hypothalamus is like your brain’s thermostat.
- **Illustration**: A brain holding a thermometer and a glass of water.

---

### **Page 14: Amygdala**
- **Function**: The emotion engine! It helps you feel emotions like fear, excitement, and happiness.
- **Example**: When you feel scared while watching a spooky movie or excited on your birthday, your amygdala is hard at work.
- **Fun Fact**: The amygdala helps you react quickly to danger to keep you safe.
- **Illustration**: A brain with different emotion faces: happy, scared, and excited.

---

### **Page 15: Motor Cortex**
- **Function**: The movement manager! It helps you move your muscles when you want to walk, run, or wave to someone.
- **Example**: When you wave goodbye to a friend, your motor cortex is in charge of moving your arm.
- **Fun Fact**: The motor cortex is connected to different muscles all over your body!
- **Illustration**: A brain character waving and running.

---

### **Page 16: Medulla**
- **Function**: The life keeper! It controls things you don’t have to think about, like breathing and your heartbeat.
- **Example**: Your medulla is working all the time to keep you breathing, even while you sleep!
- **Fun Fact**: Without the medulla, your body couldn’t do the basic things that keep you alive.
- **Illustration**: A brain character breathing calmly with a heart symbol nearby.
