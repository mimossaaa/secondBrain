- **Heroin**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Heroin binds to opioid receptors, causing an increase in dopamine release, leading to intense euphoria and pain relief.

- **Ecstasy (MDMA)**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Serotonin
  - **Action**: MDMA causes a large release of serotonin, as well as inhibiting its reuptake, leading to heightened mood, emotional closeness, and sensory perception.

- **Marijuana (THC)**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: THC binds to cannabinoid receptors, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters like GABA, which indirectly increases dopamine levels, causing relaxation and euphoria.

- **Methamphetamine**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Methamphetamine triggers the release of dopamine and blocks its reuptake, resulting in high levels of dopamine in the brain, producing intense euphoria and increased energy.

- **Alcohol**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: GABA and Glutamate
  - **Action**: Alcohol enhances the effects of GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) and reduces the activity of glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), leading to sedation and relaxation.

- **Cocaine**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Dopamine
  - **Action**: Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, allowing it to accumulate in the synapse, producing intense euphoria and increased energy.

- **LSD**:
  - **Neurotransmitter**: Serotonin
  - **Action**: LSD binds to serotonin receptors, particularly in the visual cortex, altering perception and causing hallucinations.
