### 1.1 **Interaction of Heredity and Environment**

- **Heritability**  
  - **Definition**: The proportion of variation in traits among individuals in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors.  
  - **Example**: Studies showing that intelligence has a heritability estimate of about 50%, meaning half of the variation in intelligence can be explained by genetics.

- **Twin Studies**  
  - **Definition**: Research that compares the similarities between identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins to understand the role of genetics and environment in behavior.  
  - **Example**: Comparing intelligence scores of identical twins raised apart to see if their genetics are the main factor in intellectual development.

- **Fraternal Twins (Dizygotic Twins)**  
  - **Definition**: Twins who develop from two different eggs fertilized by two different sperm, sharing about 50% of their genes like regular siblings.  
  - **Example**: Fraternal twins may have different hair colors or eye colors, unlike identical twins who share almost all their genetic material.

- **Monozygotic Twins (Identical Twins)**  
  - **Definition**: Twins who develop from a single fertilized egg that splits into two, sharing 100% of their genes.  
  - **Example**: Monozygotic twins are often studied to determine the influence of genetics on traits like personality or mental illness, since they have identical DNA.

- **Temperament**  
  - **Definition**: An individual's innate emotional reactivity and behavioral tendencies, often considered a genetic predisposition.  
  - **Example**: A child who is naturally calm and not easily upset may have an easy temperament, whereas a child who is highly sensitive and cries often may have a difficult temperament.

- **Evolutionary Psychology**  
  - **Definition**: A theoretical approach that explains psychological traits and behaviors as evolved adaptations shaped by natural selection.  
  - **Example**: The fear of spiders or snakes may have evolved because these animals posed a survival threat to early humans.

### 1.2 **Nervous System and the Neuron**

- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**  
  - **Definition**: The part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord, responsible for processing and transmitting information.  
  - **Example**: Reflex actions like pulling your hand away from a hot surface are controlled by the spinal cord in the CNS.

- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**  
  - **Definition**: The network of nerves outside the central nervous system that connects the CNS to the rest of the body.  
  - **Example**: The PNS transmits sensory information from your hand to your brain when you touch something hot.

- **Somatic Nervous System**  
  - **Definition**: The part of the peripheral nervous system that controls voluntary movements of skeletal muscles.  
  - **Example**: When you decide to raise your hand in class, the somatic nervous system activates the muscles in your arm.

- **Autonomic Nervous System**  
  - **Definition**: The part of the peripheral nervous system that controls involuntary bodily functions like heart rate, digestion, and breathing.  
  - **Example**: Your heart beats faster when you're nervous, controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

- **Sympathetic Nervous System**  
  - **Definition**: A division of the autonomic nervous system that activates the body’s "fight or flight" response in stressful situations.  
  - **Example**: When you feel threatened, your heart rate increases, and adrenaline is released as part of the sympathetic nervous system’s response.

- **Parasympathetic Nervous System**  
  - **Definition**: A division of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body and conserves energy after a stressful event.  
  - **Example**: After a stressful event, your parasympathetic nervous system slows your heart rate and restores digestion, helping you relax.
  
- **Sensory/Afferent Neurons**  
  - **Definition**: Neurons that carry information from sensory receptors in the body to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).  
  - **Example**: When you touch a hot surface, sensory neurons send signals from your skin to your brain to register pain.

- **Motor/Efferent Neurons**  
  - **Definition**: Neurons that carry information from the central nervous system to muscles and glands, allowing for movement and responses.  
  - **Example**: After the brain processes the signal from touching something hot, motor neurons send a command to your hand muscles to pull away.

- **Interneurons**  
  - **Definition**: Neurons that communicate between sensory and motor neurons, found primarily in the brain and spinal cord.  
  - **Example**: When you step on a sharp object, interneurons in the spinal cord immediately send a message to motor neurons to pull your foot back, while also relaying the pain signal to your brain.

- **Receptor Sites**  
  - **Definition**: Specific locations on the surface of a neuron that receive neurotransmitters from neighboring neurons.  
  - **Example**: When dopamine is released into the synapse, it binds to receptor sites on the postsynaptic neuron to send a signal.

- **Dendrites**  
  - **Definition**: Branch-like structures that extend from the neuron’s cell body and receive signals from other neurons.  
  - **Example**: Dendrites collect electrical signals from neighboring neurons, helping initiate the transmission of information.

- **Soma (Cell Body)**  
  - **Definition**: The central part of a neuron that contains the nucleus and maintains the cell's health.  
  - **Example**: The soma processes incoming signals from the dendrites and sends them down the axon if strong enough.

- **Axon**  
  - **Definition**: The long, tube-like structure that carries electrical impulses away from the cell body toward other neurons or muscles.  
  - **Example**: The axon transmits electrical impulses to other neurons, allowing communication across long distances in the nervous system.

- **Myelin Sheath**  
  - **Definition**: A fatty layer that insulates the axon, speeding up the transmission of electrical impulses.  
  - **Example**: In diseases like multiple sclerosis, the degradation of the myelin sheath slows down neural communication, leading to motor issues.

- **Terminal Buttons**  
  - **Definition**: The small, bulb-like structures at the end of an axon that release neurotransmitters into the synapse.  
  - **Example**: When an electrical signal reaches the terminal buttons, they release neurotransmitters that communicate with the next neuron.

- **Vesicles**  
  - **Definition**: Small sacs in the terminal buttons that store neurotransmitters and release them into the synapse.  
  - **Example**: Vesicles release serotonin into the synapse during nerve communication, affecting mood and emotional regulation.

- **Synapse**  
  - **Definition**: The small gap between neurons where neurotransmitters are released and cross to communicate with the next neuron.  
  - **Example**: When the neurotransmitter acetylcholine crosses the synapse, it signals the next neuron to activate a muscle.

- **Glial Cells**  
  - **Definition**: Non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that provide support, nourishment, and protection for neurons.  
  - **Example**: Glial cells clean up waste around neurons, supply nutrients, and maintain the environment for healthy neuron function.

### 1.3 **Neural Firing**
- **Action Potential (Depolarization)**  
  - **Definition**: A brief electrical charge that travels down the axon when a neuron becomes activated due to a change in electrical charge.  
  - **Example**: During depolarization, sodium ions flow into the neuron, making the inside more positive and initiating the action potential.

- **Repolarization**  
  - **Definition**: The process of returning the neuron to its resting state after depolarization by expelling positive ions.  
  - **Example**: After an action potential, potassium ions flow out of the neuron to restore the negative internal charge.

- **Resting Potential (Polarization)**  
  - **Definition**: The stable, negative charge of a neuron when it is inactive, typically around -70 millivolts.  
  - **Example**: A neuron at rest, before receiving a signal, is polarized with more negative ions inside than outside the cell.

- **Absolute Refractory Period**  
  - **Definition**: A period immediately following an action potential during which another action potential cannot be initiated, no matter how strong the stimulus.  
  - **Example**: During the absolute refractory period, the neuron is resetting and cannot respond to any new stimuli.

- **Relative Refractory Period**  
  - **Definition**: The period after the absolute refractory period when a neuron can only fire if the incoming stimulus is stronger than usual.  
  - **Example**: A neuron can fire again during the relative refractory period, but only if the signal is significantly stronger than normal.

- **All-or-None Law**  
  - **Definition**: The principle that a neuron either fires completely or not at all; there is no partial firing.  
  - **Example**: Once the threshold of excitation is reached, the neuron will fire at full strength regardless of the stimulus intensity.

- **Threshold of Excitation**  
  - **Definition**: The minimum level of stimulation required to trigger an action potential.  
  - **Example**: If the stimulus is strong enough to surpass the threshold, the neuron will depolarize and fire.

### 1.3 **The Endocrine System**
- **Adrenaline (Epinephrine)**  
  - **Definition**: A hormone released by the adrenal glands during stress or excitement, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels.  
  - **Example**: During a "fight or flight" response, adrenaline prepares the body to act quickly in a dangerous situation.

- **Leptin**  
  - **Definition**: A hormone produced by fat cells that regulates energy balance by inhibiting hunger.  
  - **Example**: Leptin levels rise after eating, signaling the brain to reduce appetite.

- **Melatonin**  
  - **Definition**: A hormone released by the pineal gland that regulates sleep-wake cycles and circadian rhythms.  
  - **Example**: Melatonin levels increase in the evening to promote sleep and decrease in the morning when it's time to wake up.

- **Oxytocin**  
  - **Definition**: A hormone associated with social bonding, childbirth, and trust, often called the "love hormone."  
  - **Example**: Oxytocin is released during childbirth to help with labor contractions and later to promote bonding between mother and infant.

- **Pituitary Gland**  
  - **Definition**: The "master gland" of the endocrine system that controls the release of hormones from other glands and regulates growth, metabolism, and reproduction.  
  - **Example**: The pituitary gland releases growth hormone during puberty, helping individuals grow taller.
