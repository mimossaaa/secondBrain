the water on earth makes it habitable. The abundand liquid water is neccesary for all forms of life. Earth's atmosphere is also a reason why it is habitable, having the right balance of gases. It has oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. These allow animals and plants to breath, and live on earth. The atmosphere also protects us from harmful radiation that could give us cancer. The position of the earth in the solar system also makes earth habitable, allowing it to have a not to cold or too hot temperature. The magnetic field of earth also makes it habitable, blocking harmful radiation.

today I learned about the history of the universe, and differnet objects in the universe like supernovas and neutron stars. The unvierses story starts with the big bang where the universe rapidly expanded from a singularity. After this, there were particles like quarks that were created, with atoms follwing suit. Many years later starts and galaxies started to form millions of years after the big bang. There wer also nebulas that formed, that undergoed thermonuclear reactions to create planets and stars. many billions of years later life on earth was formed.
