📍Seoul, South Korea  
🤝 An unforgettable moment: meeting Moon Jae-In, former President of South Korea.

As a UC Berkeley genetics student with aspirations in biotechnology and science diplomacy, this handshake was more than symbolic. President Moon’s leadership, rooted in dialogue, innovation, and global cooperation, deeply resonates with my own goals—bridging science and society, connecting cultures through research, and building biotech solutions that serve people across borders.


감사합니다, 대통령님 🇰🇷
