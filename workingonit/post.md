📍Seoul, South Korea  
🤝 An unforgettable moment: meeting Moon Jae-In, former President of South Korea.

As a UC Berkeley genetics student with aspirations in biotechnology and hardware entrepreneurship, this handshake was more than symbolic. President Moon’s legacy of diplomacy, resilience, and commitment to peace has left a lasting impact not just on the Korean peninsula, but on how we think about leadership in a divided world. It was an honor to shake hands with someone who embodies the idea that progress requires both courage and compassion. His leadership forever inspires me as a leader and aspiring founder.

In a world where science, leadership, and humanity must converge, this moment reaffirmed the kind of future I want to help build.





감사합니다, 대통령님 🇰🇷
