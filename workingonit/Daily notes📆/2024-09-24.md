## Planning Your Week

You’re trying to make plans to see your classmates. You need to meet with every classmate once during the week and can only meet with one person each day. Each time you complete the activity is a different week

  

Before completing the activity for each week

- If you are a group of 5, everyone cross out Sunday
    
- If you are a group of 4, everyone cross out Sunday and Saturday
    
- Before starting to schedule each week, choose a random day of that week when you’re busy and cross it out
    

  

During the activity

- Talk with your group to fill in your schedule. 
    
- Week 1 you can speak out loud. After that you can only talk on the Internet Simulator.
    

  

When you’re done

- Go through each day of the week and point to the person you’re scheduled to meet with
    
- Check that everyone’s schedules agree

Communication Problems:  As you use the simulator, record any problems you face and brainstorm solutions.

Group Rules: Make up a set of group rules your group think makes the most sense for communicating to complete this challenge. Include the ways messages should be formatted and some examples in the space below.

  

|   |

|Explain your rules|
|Write some sample messages that follow your rules|

  
Here's a new version of the schedule, where I've mixed it up while keeping Saturdays and Sundays unavailable. Each person has a different unavailable day, and everyone meets someone new each time.

|           |        |     |           |        |
| --------- | ------ | --- | --------- | ------ |
| Week 1    |        |     | Week 2    |        |
| Day       | Majid  |     | Day       | Keith  |
| Monday    | Joleen |     | Monday    | Jaden  |
| Tuesday   | Keith  |     | Tuesday   | Majid  |
| Wednesday | Jaden  |     | Wednesday | Joleen |
| Thursday  | ❎      |     | Thursday  | Keith  |
| Friday    | Majid  |     | Friday    | ❎      |
| Saturday  | ❎      |     | Saturday  | ❎      |
| Sunday    | ❎      |     | Sunday    | ❎      |

  

|           |        |     |           |        |
| --------- | ------ | --- | --------- | ------ |
| Week 3    |        |     | Week 4    |        |
| Day       | Joleen |     | Day       | Majid  |
| Monday    | Majid  |     | Monday    | Keith  |
| Tuesday   | ❎      |     | Tuesday   | Jaden  |
| Wednesday | Keith  |     | Wednesday | Majid  |
| Thursday  | Jaden  |     | Thursday  | Joleen |
| Friday    | Keith  |     | Friday    | ❎      |
| Saturday  | ❎      |     | Saturday  | ❎      |
| Sunday    | ❎      |     | Sunday    | ❎      |

Everyone now meets someone new each day, and the unavailable day has been shifted. Let me know if any adjustments are needed!

Here are five key factors that make Earth habitable:

1. **Water**: Earth has abundant liquid water, essential for all known forms of life. It provides a medium for biochemical reactions and is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in living organisms.

2. **Atmosphere**: The Earth’s atmosphere contains the right balance of gases, particularly oxygen and carbon dioxide, necessary for respiration and photosynthesis. It also protects life from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature.

3. **Temperature Range**: Earth’s position in the "Goldilocks Zone" (not too hot, not too cold) allows for a stable climate and temperature range that supports life. This range enables the existence of liquid water and diverse ecosystems.

4. **Magnetic Field**: Earth’s magnetic field protects the planet from solar and cosmic radiation, which can be harmful to living organisms. It also helps retain the atmosphere, preventing it from being stripped away by solar winds.

5. **Diverse Ecosystems**: The variety of ecosystems on Earth, from forests to oceans, provides a wide range of habitats for different organisms. This biodiversity is crucial for resilience, adaptability, and the overall health of the planet's biosphere.

- **Formation of Fundamental Particles (10^-6 seconds)**
  - Creation of quarks, electrons, and other fundamental particles.
  
- **Formation of Atoms (380,000 years post-Big Bang)**
  - Recombination era: formation of hydrogen and helium atoms.
  - Release of cosmic microwave background radiation.

  - Gravitational collapse leading to the first stars (Population III stars).
  - Formation of the first galaxies.

- **Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis (1 billion years post-Big Bang)**
  - Stars undergo fusion, creating heavier elements.
  - Supernovae distribute elements into space.

  - Formation of the Sun from a molecular cloud.
  - Formation of planets, including Earth.

- **Emergence of Life on Earth (3.5-4 billion years ago)**
  - First simple life forms: prokaryotes.
  - Evolution of photosynthesis.

- **Development of Complex Life (600 million years ago)**
  - Emergence of multicellular organisms.
  - Cambrian Explosion: rapid diversification of life.

- **Colonization of Land (500 million years ago)**
  - Evolution of plants and animals to live on land.

- **Dinosaurs and Mammals (250 million years ago to 65 million years ago)**
  - Dominance of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic Era.
  - Rise of mammals after the mass extinction event.

- **Evolution of Humans (2-3 million years ago)**
  - Hominid evolution and development of Homo sapiens.
  
- **Agricultural Revolution (10,000 years ago)**
  - Transition from nomadic lifestyles to settled farming.

- **Modern Civilization (last few thousand years)**
  - Development of writing, technology, and complex societies.
  - Industrial Revolution and advancements in science.

- **Current Era and Future (21st century and beyond)**
