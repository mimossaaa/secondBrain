I'm a high achieving, biology obsessed, stem loving high school senior. I am working on my college essays and am working on the following caltech essay.

**8. What is a favorite interest or hobby, and why does it bring you joy?**

I want you to edit this following essay to match the prompt above

**I am creative when I build terrariums, as I see it as my way to blend science, art, and nature into self-sustaining ecosystems. In middle school, I was deeply into astrophysics, and after reading the book ‚ÄúThe Martian‚Äù, I started thinking about terrariums as models for interstellar travel habitats. My first attempts were failures, as the terrariums I built molded within days, because I did not know how to create a sustainable water cycle or oxygen renewal. The failure led me to experiment, innovate, and improve. I began experimenting with materials and processes, and after a careful trial and error process, I was able to create a substrate that held the key ingredients for success. The substrate included worm castings, activated charcoal, plant matter, and dirt, it provided nutrients, filtering, and structure, creating perfect conditions for life. The search for the right materials led me to walk to local beaches, county parks, and mountains, and that‚Äôs where I found all the twigs, branches, and sticks I needed to place in my terrarium. Gathering flora and fauna became a part of my creative process as walking through a Northern California forest felt like an artistic adventure in itself. On my walk I would peel bark from fallen trees, I‚Äôd look for sowbugs, I‚Äôd flip logs searching for salamanders, and I‚Äôd stop for ostrich and fern mosses as I love how their vibrant lasting green shade fills my terrariums. My work building terrariums has not only brought me closer to nature, but it‚Äôs also made me want to become a better scientist, and it‚Äôs the reason why I want to become a plant biologist in the future. The highlight of my terrarium building experience came when I designed a Touch-Me Terrarium exhibit at the Excelsior Science Workshop, and this terrarium features the dusky Jefferson Salamander, it contains flora and fauna collected while camping in Muir Woods last summer, and it is a favorite with kids visiting the space.**

One of my favorite hobbies is building terrariums, a blend of science, art, and nature that brings me immense joy. In middle school, after reading *The Martian*, I saw terrariums as models for self-sustaining habitats. My early attempts failed‚Äîthe ecosystems I built molded within days, as I hadn‚Äôt yet learned how to balance water cycles or oxygen renewal. But that challenge fueled my curiosity. Through trial and error, I created the perfect substrate: a mix of worm castings, activated charcoal, plant matter, and dirt, which provided nutrients and filtration.  

Collecting flora and fauna for my terrariums became an adventure. I‚Äôd walk through Northern California‚Äôs forests, gathering moss, twigs, and even sowbugs and salamanders to populate my miniature ecosystems. The joy I feel while crafting these worlds stems from the perfect combination of exploration, experimentation, and scientific discovery.  

One highlight was designing a Touch-Me Terrarium for the Excelsior Science Workshop, featuring flora and fauna I gathered from Muir Woods and home to the dusky Jefferson Salamander. Seeing kids engage with it deepened my passion for biology and reinforced why I love this hobby‚Äîit connects science with creativity in a way that excites both me and others.

Recently, I've been feeling like don't have anything to do in my in between times. when I'm waiting in my boring classes, or at home after work. During these moments I have found what I should do until further notice. It would be very beneficial to learn about the republic, or to learn python. These two things can be done when I am bored in class and are very beneficial to me. Rather than watching Kdramas in class, I should have the plato video open in order to learn. If not this, then I should learn python.
