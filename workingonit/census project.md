#### **Key Terms**  
- **Census**: The procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a population. First used in the U.S. in 1790.
- **Demographics**: The statistical characteristics of human populations (age, income, race, languages, gender, etc.).
- **Intersectionality**: How social identities (e.g., demographic characteristics) are intertwined and impacted by systems of oppression.
- **Systems of Oppression**: Societal systems that marginalize and exploit certain groups to elevate and privilege others.
- **Household**: A household consists of one or more people living in the same dwelling and sharing meals.

### **Project Description**  
**Goal**: Use data to make visible parts of your community that have been ignored or made invisible. Data is a powerful tool that influences policies. But what happens when relevant data about communities is not gathered? How can institutions be challenged for failing to acknowledge critical data?

You will create a census survey that sheds light on overlooked community issues. This project will combine your studies in **U.S. Census in American Democracy** and **Senior Literature essays**, which discuss how people are marginalized by systems of oppression.

#### **Steps**:  
1. **Survey Creation**:  
   - Use **Google Forms** to design a survey that collects demographic data.  
   - Ask **at least 30 households** (neighbors, relatives, friends, teachers, acquaintances) to take the survey.
   - Only one individual per household can complete the survey to avoid double-counting.  
   - If working alone, gather data from at least **15 households**. In groups, gather data from at least **30 households**.

2. **Excellent groups from last year gathered data from 50+ respondents—aim for as much data as possible**. You may take each other’s surveys to better understand your community.

---

### **Purpose**  
Your survey data will serve as a representation of a “neighborhood,” “community,” or “district” with unique demographic variables that you'll reference throughout the year in **American Democracy** and **Economics**.

In addition to the basic demographic data, include at least **two additional topics** of interest that you feel are overlooked in your community.

---

### **Final Product**  
- **Survey**: Completed by the required number of households.  
- **Four-Page Summary**: Analyzing the demographic information collected.  
  (Details for the summary will be provided later.)
