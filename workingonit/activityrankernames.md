Got it. For a startup-ready name—especially one you want to pitch to VCs—you’ll want something that is:

* **Brandable**: short, memorable, and unique
* **Flexible**: not limited to streamers or a niche use case
* **Evocative**: hints at action, community, ranking, or decision-making
* **Available**: .com domains ideally (we can check availability later)

Here’s a curated list grouped by theme, all crafted with a **startup/VC pitch vibe** in mind:

---

### 🔥 Top-Tier Brandable & VC-Friendly

These are sleek, broad, and pass the “would Sequoia invest in this?” test:

* **Ranko** (short, sounds like a unicorn already)
* **Uplyst** (suggestion + list + uplift)
* **Vota** (Latin for "votes," clean and international)
* **Elevyn** (evokes elevation + group consensus, modern spelling)
* **Suggesta** (brandable, broad—like “Spotify for suggestions”)
* **Tallyfy** (evokes counting, voting, and rhythm)
* **Crowdly** (community-focused, sounds social and startup-y)
* **Ideavault** (strong, secure, and expansive)
* **Climber** (implies ranking, movement, growth)
* **Trenda** (trending + agenda)
