Here’s a breakdown of the plants from your list with their descriptions and compatibility for a vertical living wall:

Here is the updated breakdown with optimal growing conditions included for each plant:

### 1. **Shelling Peas**
- **Description:** Annual climbing plant producing edible pods and peas. Fast-growing with tendrils that help it cling to support structures. Compact and bushy when mature.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers cool weather, full sun to partial shade, and well-drained, fertile soil. Best grown in spring or fall when temperatures are cooler.
- **Compatibility:** Ideal for a vertical wall due to its climbing nature. It grows quickly and can cover the wall well but may require regular replanting.

### 2. **Hybrid Yellow Zucchini Squash**
- **Description:** A bushy plant producing elongated, yellow fruits. Fast-growing and heavy-yielding, but it does not naturally climb.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Requires full sun, well-drained soil, and regular watering. Thrives in warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not well-suited for a vertical wall as it tends to spread outwards rather than climb. Better for ground-level or large container growth.

### 3. **Hybrid Hot Peppers**
- **Description:** Compact plant with small, colorful, and spicy peppers. Produces a high yield of peppers per plant. Upright growth habit.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Needs full sun, well-drained soil, and warm temperatures. Prefers consistent watering but not overwatering.
- **Compatibility:** Not ideal for a vertical wall since it does not have a climbing or vining habit. Could be used in pots at the base for color and variety.

### 4. **Specialty Beets**
- **Description:** Root vegetable with leafy greens growing above ground. Quick to mature and highly nutritious. Leaves can also be harvested for greens.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers cool weather, full sun to partial shade, and loose, well-drained soil. Requires consistent moisture.
- **Compatibility:** Poor choice for a vertical wall due to its lack of vining growth. More suited for garden beds or containers.

### 5. **Hybrid White Cauliflower**
- **Description:** Compact, cool-weather vegetable producing large, dense heads. Slow-growing and requires substantial space.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers full sun, rich, well-drained soil, and cool temperatures. Needs consistent watering and protection from excessive heat.
- **Compatibility:** Not suitable for vertical walls as it doesn’t climb or spread. Requires significant space and support for optimal growth.

### 6. **Round Red Beets**
- **Description:** Edible root crop with dark green leafy tops. Fast-growing and versatile in the kitchen. Non-climbing; compact growth habit.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Thrives in cool weather, full sun to partial shade, and well-drained, loose soil. Needs regular watering.
- **Compatibility:** Not recommended for a vertical wall as it lacks climbing tendencies. Better for ground-level cultivation.

### 7. **Hybrid Bunching Onions**
- **Description:** Herbaceous perennial with long, green stalks. Does not produce a bulb like standard onions. Upright growth habit.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers full sun to partial shade, well-drained soil, and consistent moisture. Tolerates cool to warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not a climber, so it won’t spread up the wall. Could be grown in small pockets but is not ideal for vertical cultivation.

### 8. **Bush Beans**
- **Description:** Compact, bushy plant producing edible pods. Fast-growing but does not climb. Best harvested young for tender pods.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Requires full sun, well-drained soil, and consistent watering. Grows best in warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not suitable for vertical walls since it does not have climbing or vining properties. Best suited for ground-level or container growth.

### 9. **Multileaf Lettuce**
- **Description:** Leafy green with a dense, compact growth habit. Quick to mature and great for cut-and-come-again harvesting.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers cool weather, partial shade to full sun, and well-drained, fertile soil. Needs regular watering.
- **Compatibility:** Not well-suited for vertical walls as it doesn’t climb. Better for ground-level cultivation or small containers.

### 10. **Hybrid Bicolor SH2 Corn**
- **Description:** Tall, upright-growing plant producing cobs with bicolored kernels. Slow to mature but highly productive.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Requires full sun, rich, well-drained soil, and ample space. Needs consistent moisture and warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not a suitable option for a vertical wall. Corn requires a lot of vertical space but doesn’t attach or climb.

### 11. **Butterhead Lettuce**
- **Description:** Leafy green with a compact, rounded growth habit. Soft, buttery leaves ideal for salads.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers cool weather, partial shade to full sun, and well-drained soil. Needs regular watering.
- **Compatibility:** Not ideal for vertical walls due to its lack of climbing or vining properties. Best grown in containers or beds.

### 12. **Hybrid Acorn Winter Squash**
- **Description:** Produces small, ribbed fruits with a bushy growth habit. Slow to mature and does not naturally climb.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Needs full sun, well-drained soil, and consistent moisture. Prefers warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not well-suited for a vertical wall due to its bushy nature. Could be trained to grow on a trellis, but not ideal.

### 13. **Pole Beans**
- **Description:** Climbing plant producing long, edible pods. Fast-growing and covers vertical structures with vines. High yield per plant.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Requires full sun, well-drained soil, and regular watering. Grows best in warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Excellent choice for a vertical wall. Its natural climbing habit makes it ideal for spreading upwards and filling empty spaces quickly.

### 14. **Swiss Chard**
- **Description:** Leafy green vegetable with brightly colored stalks. Upright but does not climb; needs support for upright growth.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers full sun to partial shade, well-drained soil, and consistent watering. Tolerates cool to warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not a climber, so it’s not suitable for a vertical wall. Better for garden beds or containers.

### 15. **Hybrid Single Stem Sunflower**
- **Description:** Tall plant producing large, yellow flowers on a single stem. Does not branch; very top-heavy.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Needs full sun, well-drained soil, and regular watering. Grows best in warm to hot temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not suitable for vertical walls due to its lack of climbing habit. It requires a lot of vertical space but needs support.

### 16. **Greenhouse Cucumbers**
- **Description:** Vigorous, climbing plant producing elongated, edible cucumbers. Fast-growing and prolific.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers full sun, well-drained, fertile soil, and consistent moisture. Grows best in warm, sheltered conditions.
- **Compatibility:** Excellent choice for a vertical wall. It climbs well, spreads upwards, and can fill empty spaces effectively.

### 17. **Hybrid Kale**
- **Description:** Leafy green vegetable with a bushy, upright growth habit. Highly nutritious and hardy.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Prefers cool weather, full sun to partial shade, and well-drained soil. Needs regular watering.
- **Compatibility:** Not ideal for a vertical wall as it lacks climbing tendencies. More suited for garden beds or containers.

### 18. **Hybrid Specialty Melons**
- **Description:** Produces small, sweet fruits on long vines. Slow to moderate growth rate with vines that can be trained to climb.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Requires full sun, well-drained soil, and consistent moisture. Needs warm temperatures and support for heavy fruits.
- **Compatibility:** Can be used on a vertical wall with support. The vining habit is a plus, but the weight of the fruit may require additional support.

### 19. **Hybrid Asian Eggplant**
- **Description:** Produces slender, purple fruits on upright plants. Compact with moderate yields.
- **Optimal Growing Conditions:** Needs full sun, well-drained soil, and regular watering. Prefers warm temperatures.
- **Compatibility:** Not suitable for a vertical wall as it does not climb. Better for ground-level or container cultivation.

### **Recommendations:**
For a vertical living wall, **Pole Beans**, **Greenhouse Cucumbers**, **Shelling Peas**, and **Hybrid Specialty Melons** (with support) would be the most compatible choices due to their climbing and vining nature, as well as their ability to fill vertical space effectively.
