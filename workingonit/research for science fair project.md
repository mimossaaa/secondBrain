otters
	Sea otters spend a great deal of time floating on their backs at the surface. They move by paddling their hind limbs and sculling with their tails. For rapid swimming and for diving, they swim similarly to other otters, using up-and-down undulations of the body.

Characteristics


| Freestyle Stroke Characteristics | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flutter Kicking**              | Continuous and rhythmic kicking of the legs, typically with a straight body position.                                      |
| **Alternating Arm Movements**    | Continuous and alternating arm movements, reaching forward and pulling through the water.                                  |
| **Face-Down Position**           | Swimmer's face is submerged in the water, allowing for effective breathing through rhythmic turns of the head to the side. |
| **Continuous and Fluid Motion**  | Freestyle is known for its continuous and fluid motion, creating a streamlined and efficient swimming technique.           |
| **Frontal Breathing**            | Breathing is typically performed by turning the head to the side during arm recovery.                                      |
| **Streamlined Body Position**    | Swimmer maintains a horizontal and streamlined body position to minimize drag in the water.                                |



| Aquatic Animal | Locomotion Resemblance to Freestyle Stroke                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tuna           | Streamlined bodies and continuous swimming motions parallel the streamlined nature and constant movement of freestyle swimmers.             |
| Dolphins       | Undulating body movements, powerful tail kicks, and streamlined swimming share similarities with the fluid and continuous freestyle stroke. |
| Swordfish      | Streamlined body and continuous swimming using a powerful tail, resembling the efficiency and continuous motion of freestyle swimming.      |
| Bonito Fish    | Fast swimmers with a streamlined body, showcasing efficient and continuous swimming, akin to the freestyle stroke.                          |
| Mackerel       | Rapid and continuous swimming with muscular bodies and tails, similar to the constant flutter kicking and movement in freestyle swimming.   |

abstract
	As a swimmer, in my countless hours in the pool I wondered how my strokes could relate to the countless aquatic animals who spent all their lives swimming away in the water. Knowing I had to find a research topic for the science fair I wanted to compete in, I realized this was a great Idea. Fish locomotion is mostly divided up into 2 classes based on whether or not they create waves with their body. Those that do are called undulatory motion, and those that don't are called oscillatory motion. These can be further classified into the percentage of the body that is undulating. I used these characteristics along with others to be able to classify and find which aquatic animals each swim stroke is most similar to.
procedure
	the first phase of my research was based mostly on learning about the current classification systems in place for aquatic locomotion. I also learned about variolous species and their types of locomotion in order to create some hypothesizes about what strokes could be similar to what organisms. 
	The second part was gathering some data to be able to prove my claims. I recorded videos of myself swimming the 4 different strokes with my friend. I compared those videos to videos of my hypothesized species swimming, and took snapshots from the videos in which the human and animal swimmers looked alike. 
	the third part of my research was using computer models of swimmers to compare those with my hypothesized species. I initially planned to use CFD on my own body, but changed to using models generated in swum, a software which simulates swimming.

Bernoulli's theorem
	if the fluid flows horizontally so that no change in gravitational potential energy occurs, then a decrease in fluid pressure is associated with an increase in fluid velocity

It's a non dimensional parameter that is the ratio of the inertia of the flow to the viscous forces in the flow.

It is found in the naiver - stokes equation that describes how velocity, pressure temperature density are of a moving fluid are related
