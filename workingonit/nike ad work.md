**What is this brand encoding and promising to provide for the audience if they join its cult? How does it do so?**


This Nike ad successfully encodes the brand's promise to provide resilience, perseverance and identity for those who join it's cult. This is executed through this beautifully crafted 30 second ad. We are presented many runners, from different countries, different ethnicities, and different genders. these runners face the same challenges, running through rain, puddles, and muddy streets. The diverse cast presents Nike as an inclusive brand (which we'll visit later), and tells a story that everyone and anyone can overcome any challenge given the right tools, which are, you guessed it, Nike products. 

Juxtaposing the cheery, jolly song  "you are my sunshine", with the gritty videos of the runners, a contrast is built. This contrast is used to subtly create an emotional promise, that Nike products, along with the culture and community they create will bring out happiness, and inner strength. Through rain, puddles, darkness, and mud these runners keep going. Through their legs and feet, they embody grit and determination. By showing these determined, resilient runners, Nike quietly delivers the idea that by using Nike products, you can be resilient, and win in your sport, or in life. 
 
Through the subtle placement of Nike products, with the short shots of vests, or emphasized scenes of putting your hoodie on, these products are pushed. 
It is most interesting that Nike doesn't show the special capacities of their products, and barely shows their logo for two seconds, but it's because they don't have to. Nike knows people trust their product, and they know that their capabilities aren't what people are interested in anymore, much less what will get people hooked on their ads. They want to present themselves as a community. This is clear from the insistence of diversity throughout the ad. If I want to improve my running gear for a more comfortable running experience, what do I care if the brand sells to a diverse community, it's not like I was joining a club or group. But it is! Nike wants you to think of it as a community, rather than a brand. This makes people identify with it, and feel better about spending money, and stay up to date on all the brand news, overall increasing revenue!  

In conclusion, Nike promises a community, a diverse group of athletes pushing past adversity. With only 30 seconds, the ad is able to create aa sense of community, by showing relatable athletes, and positioning the brand as part of a healthy and disciplined lifestyle, allowing you to better your life. All of this is done while subtly displaying it's products, reinforcing the connection between community, and performance, with Nike gear.
