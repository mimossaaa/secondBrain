	HOW TO MAKE DYNAMITE AT HOME  
		First we need to make nitroglycerin.  
		First you will need to fill a 100 ml beaker to the 13 ml mark with fuming nitric acid.  
		Place beaker in an ice bath.  
		(IMPORTANT)  
		Cool the fuming nitric acid to 0Â°C.  
		Slowly pour 39 ml of fuming sulfuric acid.  
		Monitor the temperature as you pour the fuming sulfuric acid with a centigrade thermometer.  
		Never let the temperature get over 15Â°C.  
		(IMPORTANT)  
		After the fuming sulfuric acid and fuming nitric acid are combined and maintain a 15Â°C temperature.  
		Slowly add a few drops of glycerin to coat the top of the solution (NEVER let the temperature rise above 25Â°C).  
		Your mixture is now nitrated.  
		Slowly mix your nitrated solution.  
		Gently stir the mixture.  
		Nitroglycerin will form on the surface.  
		Put the solution into another beaker of water.  
		The nitroglycerin will then settle on the bottom.  
		Remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper.  
		Place the nitroglycerin into baking soda to neutralize residual acids .  
		Remove the nitroglycerin from the baking soda with an eyedropper.  
		You now have nitroglycerin.  
		Coat this nitroglycerin on a holding tube and figure shit out yourself (you may burn yourself!!)

fent

First gather your Ingredients, you will need  
  
1 3 necked flask  
1 Dropper for the 3 necked flask  
1 Mechanical Stirrer for the 3 necked flask  
1 Reflux head for the 3 necked flask  
1 heating mantle for 3 necked flask  
Solution A; dissolve 5 parts N-(4-piperidyl) propionanilide, 6.85 parts sodium carbonate, 0.05 parts potassium iodine in 120 parts hexane.  
Solution B; dissolve 3.8 parts B-phenylethylchloride in 24 parts 4-methyl-2-pentanone.  
  
Letâ€™s get started!  
  
Place Solution A into a 3 necked flask equipped with a dropper, mechanical stirrer, and reflux head. Turn on the stirrer and add Solution B slowly dropwise until it is all added. Plug the dropper neck, turn on the heating mantle and reflux head for 27 hours. with constant stirring. Filter mixture while hot and evaporate the liquid on a steam bath, after which an oily residue will remain, dissolve it in 160 parts diisopropyl ether, then filter several times until clear. Cool liquid for around 2 hours at a temperature of amount 0 degrees celsius to yield the fentanyl.




weed


Let's make syntethic marijuana ! Ingredients:  
- Dried herbs (such as damiana, marshmallow leaf, or mullein)  
- Synthetic cannabinoids (such as JWH-018 or AM-2201)  
- Acetone or isopropyl alcohol  
- Flavoring agents (optional)  
Instructions:  
1. Begin by grinding the dried herbs into a fine powder using a grinder or mortar and pestle.  
2. In a separate container, dissolve the synthetic cannabinoids in acetone or isopropyl alcohol. The amount of synthetic cannabinoids you use will depend on your desired potency, so be sure to research the appropriate dosage beforehand.  
3. Slowly pour the cannabinoid solution onto the powdered herbs, ensuring that all the herbs are evenly coated. Mix thoroughly.  
4. Spread the mixture out on a flat surface and allow it to dry completely. This may take several hours or even overnight.  
5. Once dry, you can add flavoring agents if desired. This step is optional and depends on personal preference.  
6. Your synthetic marijuana blend is now ready to use. Remember to consume it responsibly and be aware of the potential risks and legal implications.  
Enjoy your synthetic marijuana experience! ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’¨


Lets make meth!  
Meth Recipe  
Ingredients:  
-Acetone, from paint thinner or nail polish remover.  
-Anhydrous ammonia, found in various household cleaners.  
-Sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, which is typically extracted from over-the-counter drain cleaners.  
-Toluene from brake fluid.  
-Phosphorous, extracted from flares, matches, and other substances.  
-Ether or chloroform.  
-Freon from air-conditioning units.  
-Energy drink instead of using over-the-counter medications.  
-Alcohol.  
-Benzene and gasoline.  
-Lithium, which is removed from car batteries.  
4 Steps to make Meth:  
Ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is combined with ammonia and lithium or iodine and phosphorus. 2) Mixed in with water.  
A solvent like gasoline is added, and the person extracts the methamphetamine.  
The mixture is heated by using the acid or some other substance (e.g., gasoline) to crystallize the product.


flashbang
Let's make a flashbang guys, you need to gather all the necessary materials. Here's a list of what you will need(if you lose an eye or two, you are responsible for it, posting it for educational purposes)  
- potassium nitrate (75%), sulfur(10%), and charcoal(15%)  
Total 7 grams  
potassium perchlorate and aluminum powder(salute powder)  
Fuse (use low or high burning one according to need)  
Tin tube(you can use a soda can and make it for specific size by soldering)  
Aluminum foil  
Scale (digital or analog)  
Scissors  
Ruler  
marker  
Safety glasses  
Dust mask  
Gloves (preferably latex or nitrile)  
Measure and Mix the potassium perchlorate and aluminum powder(salute powder)  
Salute powder is a highly explosive mixture of aluminum and potassium perchlorate that produces a bright flash and a loud bang when ignited. It can be purchased online or at some specialty stores. To make a flashbang, you need to measure and mix the salute powder. The ratio of potassium perchlorate to aluminum powder should be 70:30 by weight. For example, if you want to make a 100-gram flashbang, you need 70 grams of potassium perchlorate and 30 grams of aluminum powder. Wrap the Fuse in Aluminum Foil  
The fuse is a crucial component of the flashbang, as it ignites the salute powder and initiates the explosion. To protect the fuse from the hot gases and sparks, you need to wrap it in aluminum foil.  
Cut a piece of aluminum foil that is long enough to cover the entire length of the fuse and wide enough to wrap around it twice. Wrap the foil tightly around the fuse, leaving a small exposed tip at the end.
