**K2-18b**
   - **Location**: About 124 light-years away in the constellation Leo.
   - **Size**: About 2.6 times the radius of Earth.
   - **Atmosphere**: Hydrogen-rich with potential water vapor detected.
   - **Habitability Potential**: Lies in the habitable zone of its star, a red dwarf (M-dwarf). There may be liquid water beneath its atmosphere, with a mix of gases that could support life.
   - **Challenges**: Its atmosphere could contain high levels of gases like methane or ammonia, which might pose challenges for life as we know it.
   - **Temperature**: May have temperatures allowing for liquid water, but thick clouds could obscure the surface, and the environment is likely high-pressure.



## Story

brainstorm
	in the next 500 years, the k218b planet is thrown out of it's system by the start it was orbiting by something
		options of what this could be:
			migrating towards the mily way, two suns and sytems combine
			-
			this causes the gravity to be strange and the planets to have some different orbits based on how the sun works.
			-
			this causes the planet to have a changed orbit and lead more astray from the planet
			-
			there is a supernova in leo which causes shockwaves and gravitational disturbnaces and flings a planet away into the buttes void
			-
			gets pushed away to the buttes void
			-
			sometime through this process the planet is bombarded with asteroids
			-
			these asteroids are floating at a region within the water

the planet's life
	the planet was full of vibrant life, such as the huge prdators, who's sekeletons can still be seen underground. 

the displacemtn of the planet causes all plant life to die, this also causes the ice layer to form 

the organisms at the bottom of the ocean don't die
they stay alive because their life dosen't change much.
these organisms proliferate and end up dominating for some years due to all the marine snow and carcasses which come down.

some get to adapt to the new style of life and the evolution starts

**lead zirconium titanate** crystals exist on the sea floor
organisms come in contact with this, and get electrically shoecked sometimes

eventually, mutations form and some organisms can use this to get an extra enegry boost.

these orgnisms end up dominating, and proliferating
