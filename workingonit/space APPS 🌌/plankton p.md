To design a plankton-like species that could survive in a chemosynthetic ecosystem, consider a **chemoautotrophic plankton** that resembles real-world bacteria or protists but adapted to deep-sea conditions. Here’s an example based on principles of chemosynthesis:

### **Species Concept: Chemoplankton**
- **Size and Structure**: Tiny, free-floating microorganisms similar to plankton, potentially single-celled or small colonies.
- **Energy Source**: They rely on chemical compounds released from hydrothermal vents or cold seeps, such as hydrogen sulfide or methane.
- **Chemosynthetic Process**: 
  - These planktonic organisms use **hydrogen sulfide** (H₂S) or **methane** (CH₄) from the ocean floor.
  - They oxidize these compounds to produce energy, which is then used to fix carbon dioxide (CO₂) into organic molecules (sugars), much like phytoplankton use sunlight in photosynthesis.

### **Ecological Role**:
- **Primary Producers**: Just as photosynthetic plankton form the base of the food web in sunlit ocean waters, these chemoplankton would be foundational to the ecosystem. Larger organisms, such as filter feeders or small predators, could consume them.
- **Distribution**: These plankton would thrive in deep, dark ocean environments near chemical-rich areas such as hydrothermal vents or cold seeps, where their energy source is abundant.
- **Adaptations**:
  - **High pressure tolerance**: To survive deep in the ocean.
  - **Specialized enzymes**: To efficiently catalyze chemical reactions needed for chemosynthesis, similar to the adaptations of bacteria living near deep-sea vents.

### **Real-World Analog**:  
In real life, certain **bacteria** (like *Thiovulum spp.*) and **archaea** that live near hydrothermal vents or cold seeps already fill a role similar to this hypothetical chemoplankton. These microbes thrive on chemicals like sulfur and methane, supporting entire ecosystems in the deep ocean.

In your ocean world, you can imagine that a chemoplankton species could be free-floating, drifting through the water, and feeding off chemical-rich environments—playing a vital role in sustaining life in a world without sunlight.
