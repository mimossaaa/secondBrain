### **Energy**

Energy is fundamental to, well, everything! In environmental science, we're often concerned with how we generate it, how we use it, and the impact it has on our planet.

1. **Current, Voltage**
    - **Current (I):** Think of electricity like water flowing through a pipe. **Current** is the rate of flow of electric charge – how much charge is passing a point in a circuit per second. It's measured in **Amperes (Amps or A)**.
        - Intuition: A wide river has a high current (lots of water flowing); a small stream has a low current.
    - **Voltage (V):** This is the "push" or "electrical pressure" that makes the electric charge flow. It's the difference in electric potential energy between two points in a circuit. It's measured in **Volts (V)**.
        - Intuition: If current is the water flow, voltage is like the water pressure. Higher pressure (voltage) can push more water (current) through the pipe.
        
2. **Power Plant, Magnet, Coils of wire, Turbine, Generator**
    - These terms are all best buddies when it comes to making most of our electricity!
    - **Power Plant:** This is the big facility where electricity is generated on a large scale. It could be a coal plant, nuclear plant, hydroelectric dam, wind farm, etc.
    - **Turbine:** Imagine a very sophisticated pinwheel or a fan. A **turbine** has blades that are turned by a moving fluid (like steam, water, or wind). Its job is to convert the kinetic energy of the fluid into rotational mechanical energy.
    - **Generator:** This is the heart of electricity production. A **generator** takes the rotational energy from the turbine and converts it into electrical energy.
    - **How they connect (the magic!):** Inside a generator, you typically have **Magnets** and **Coils of wire**. The turbine spins the magnet (or coils of wire, depending on the design) very fast relative to the other. This rapid change in the magnetic field around the coils of wire "excites" the electrons in the wire and makes them flow – creating an electric current! This principle is called electromagnetic induction.
        - Simplified Flow: Fuel (coal, gas, nuclear, wind, water) -> Heats water to make Steam (or directly uses wind/water) -> Steam/Wind/Water spins a **Turbine** -> Turbine spins a shaft connected to a **Generator** -> Generator (with its **Magnets** and **Coils of wire**) produces Electricity.
    
3. **Watts, Kilowatt Hours, Power, Energy**
    
    - **Power (P):** This is the rate at which energy is used or generated. Think of it as "how fast" energy is flowing. It's measured in **Watts (W)**. A 100W light bulb uses energy faster than a 60W light bulb.
        - Formula: Power = Energy / Time
    - **Energy (E):** This is the total amount of work done or the total amount of "juice" consumed or produced over a period. The standard scientific unit is Joules (J), but for electricity, we often use **Kilowatt-hours (kWh)**.
        - Intuition: If power is like your speed (miles per hour), energy is like the total distance you traveled (miles).
    - **Watts (W):** The unit of power. 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second.
    - **Kilowatt Hours (kWh):** This is a unit of energy, NOT power. It's the amount of energy you'd use if you ran a 1-kilowatt (1000 Watts) appliance for 1 hour.
        - Example: A 100W light bulb (which is 0.1 kW) left on for 10 hours uses: 0.1 kW * 10 hours = 1 kWh of energy. This is what your electricity bill measures!
        
4. **Utility Bill, Time of Use, Tiered Rate**
    - **Utility Bill:** This is the bill you get from the electricity company. It tells you how much energy (in kWh) you consumed during a billing period and how much you owe.
    - **Time of Use (TOU) Pricing:** Some utility companies charge different rates for electricity depending on the time of day you use it. It's usually more expensive during "peak hours" (e.g., late afternoon/early evening when everyone is home using appliances) and cheaper during "off-peak" hours (e.g., late at night). This is done to encourage people to shift their energy use to times when there's less demand on the grid.
    - **Tiered Rate:** This is a pricing structure where the price per kWh increases as your consumption increases.
        - Example:
            - The first 500 kWh might cost $0.10/kWh.
            - The next 500 kWh (from 501 to 1000 kWh) might cost $0.15/kWh.
            - Anything above 1000 kWh might cost $0.20/kWh.
        - This system is designed to encourage energy conservation. The more you use, the more expensive each additional unit of energy becomes.

### **Energy Audit**

An energy audit is like a detective investigation to find out where energy is being used (and wasted!) in a home or building, and how to save it.

1. **Energy Efficiency, Energy Conservation**
    - These two sound similar but have a key difference:
    - **Energy Efficiency:** This means using less energy to perform the same task. You're getting the same service or output but with less energy input.
        - Example: Replacing an old incandescent light bulb with an LED bulb. Both light up the room, but the LED uses much less energy. A car that gets 40 miles per gallon is more efficient than one that gets 20 mpg.
    - **Energy Conservation:** This means reducing or going without an energy-consuming service to save energy. It's often about behavior changes.
        - Example: Turning off lights when you leave a room, taking shorter showers, or choosing to walk instead of drive for short trips.
        
2. **Lightmeter, Wattmeter**
    
    - These are tools used in an energy audit:
    - **Lightmeter (or Lux Meter):** Measures the amount of light (illuminance) in an area. It can help determine if a space is overlit (wasting energy) or underlit. Measured in Lux or foot-candles.
    - **Wattmeter:** Measures the electrical power (in Watts) being consumed by an individual appliance in real-time. You plug the appliance into the wattmeter, and the wattmeter into the wall. This helps identify energy-hungry devices.
        
3. **Plug Load, Phantom Load**
    
    - **Plug Load:** Refers to the energy consumed by all the devices that are plugged into electrical outlets. This includes computers, TVs, chargers, kitchen appliances, etc
    - **Phantom Load (or Vampire Load or Standby Power):** This is the electricity consumed by electronic devices when they are turned off or in standby mode. Many devices (TVs, game consoles, microwaves, chargers) continue to draw a small amount of power even when not actively in use, just to be ready to power on quickly or to maintain settings. This can add up to a surprising amount of wasted energy!
        - Think: The little light on your TV that stays on even when the TV is "off."

### **Atmospheric Dynamics**

This section is all about how our atmosphere works, driving weather and climate.

1. **Differential Heating of Earth, Wind**
    
    - **Differential Heating of Earth:** The Earth is not heated evenly by the sun. The Equator receives more direct, intense sunlight throughout the year, making it warmer. The poles receive sunlight at a much lower angle (and none for part of the year), making them colder. This difference in heating is crucial.
        
    - **Wind:** This uneven heating is the primary driver of wind!
        - Warm air (e.g., at the equator) is less dense and rises. This creates an area of lower pressure at the surface.
        - Cool air (e.g., at the poles, or higher in the atmosphere) is denser and sinks. This creates an area of higher pressure at the surface.
        - **Wind is simply air moving from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure** to try and even things out.
        
2. **Specific Heat Capacity**
    - This is a property of a substance. It's the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of that substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 Kelvin).
    - **Water has a very high specific heat capacity.** This means it takes a lot of energy to heat water up, and water releases a lot of energy when it cools down. It resists changes in temperature.
        - Significance: This is why coastal areas often have milder climates than inland areas (oceans moderate temperature). It's also why water is great for storing heat. Land, on the other hand, has a lower specific heat capacity, so it heats up and cools down much faster than water.
        
3. **Coriolis Effect (Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley Cells)**
    
    - **Coriolis Effect:** Because the Earth is rotating, any object moving freely across its surface (like air or water) will appear to be deflected from its straight path.
        - In the **Northern Hemisphere**, moving objects are deflected to their **right**.
        - In the **Southern Hemisphere**, moving objects are deflected to their **left**.
        - The effect is strongest at the poles and zero at the equator.
        - Intuition: Imagine trying to roll a ball straight across a spinning merry-go-round. To you on the merry-go-round, the ball would curve.
    - **Global Atmospheric Circulation Cells:** The combination of differential heating and the Coriolis effect creates large-scale patterns of air circulation in the atmosphere called cells:
        - **Hadley Cells:** (Roughly 0° to 30° latitude N & S)
            - Warm, moist air rises at the Equator (low pressure, lots of rain – think tropical rainforests).
            - This air travels poleward at high altitudes, cools, and then sinks around 30° latitude (high pressure, dry air – think deserts).
            - The surface air then flows back towards the equator (trade winds), deflected by Coriolis.  
        - **Ferrel Cells:** (Roughly 30° to 60° latitude N & S)
            - These are more complex, acting like a gear between Hadley and Polar cells.
            - Air on the surface generally flows poleward and is deflected to the east (creating the "westerlies" in mid-latitudes, where many of us live).
            - Air rises around 60° latitude (low pressure, often moist and stormy).
        - **Polar Cells:** (Roughly 60° to 90° latitude N & S)
            - Cold, dry air sinks at the Poles (high pressure).
            - This air flows equatorward at the surface (polar easterlies), deflected by Coriolis.
            - It rises around 60° latitude where it meets warmer air from the Ferrel cell.

4. **Biomes, Climatographs**
    - **Biomes:** These are very large ecological areas on the Earth's surface, with fauna and flora (animals and plants) adapting to their environment. Biomes are often defined by abiotic (non-living) factors such as climate, relief, geology, soils, and vegetation.
        - Examples: Tropical rainforest, desert, grassland, tundra, taiga (boreal forest), temperate deciduous forest.
        - The global circulation cells (Hadley, Ferrel, Polar) play a huge role in determining the climate, and thus the biomes, found at different latitudes.
    - **Climatographs (or Climographs):** A graphical representation of basic climatic parameters, usually average monthly temperature and precipitation, at a certain location.
        - Temperature is often shown as a line graph, and precipitation as a bar graph.
        - By looking at a climatograph, you can get a good idea of the climate of an area and often infer what biome is likely to be found there. (e.g., hot and wet year-round suggests tropical rainforest; hot and dry suggests desert).

### **Plant Evolution & Adaptations**

Plants have undergone an incredible evolutionary journey, developing amazing ways to survive and reproduce.

1. **Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms**
    - These are major groups in plant evolution, showing increasing complexity and adaptation to terrestrial life:
    - **Bryophytes (e.g., mosses, liverworts, hornworts):**
        - The earliest land plants.
        - **Non-vascular** (lack true roots, stems, and leaves with specialized transport tissues).
        - Small, grow close to the ground in moist environments.
        - Reproduce via **spores**. Need water for sperm to swim to egg.
    - **Pteridophytes (e.g., ferns, horsetails, club mosses):**
        - Evolved after bryophytes.
        - **Vascular** (have xylem and phloem for transporting water and nutrients), allowing them to grow taller.
        - Have true roots, stems, and leaves.
        - Reproduce via **spores**. Still mostly rely on moist conditions for reproduction.
    - **Gymnosperms (e.g., conifers like pines and firs, cycads, ginkgoes):**
        - "Naked seed" plants.
        - **Vascular**.
        - Reproduce via **seeds**, which are a major evolutionary innovation (embryo + food supply + protective coat). Seeds are not enclosed in a fruit.
        - Often have **cones** (male cones produce pollen, female cones contain ovules that become seeds).
        - Pollen (containing sperm) is typically wind-dispersed, reducing reliance on water for fertilization.
    - **Angiosperms (Flowering Plants):**
        - The most diverse and widespread group of plants today.
        - **Vascular**.
        - Reproduce via **seeds** that are enclosed within a protective **fruit** (which develops from the **flower**).
        - **Flowers** are specialized reproductive structures that often attract animal pollinators (insects, birds, bats), leading to more efficient fertilization. Fruits aid in seed dispersal.
2. **Vascular, Spores, Seeds, Cones, Flowers** (Key structures and reproductive units)
    - **Vascular (tissue):** Specialized plant tissues – **xylem** (transports water and minerals up from roots) and **phloem** (transports sugars produced during photosynthesis from leaves to other parts of the plant). Allows plants to grow tall and live in drier conditions.
    - **Spores:** Single-celled reproductive units used by bryophytes and pteridophytes. They are typically very small and can be dispersed by wind or water, but require favorable (often moist) conditions to germinate and grow.
    - **Seeds:** A major evolutionary step! A seed contains a multicellular **embryo**, a **food supply** (endosperm or cotyledons), and a protective **seed coat**. Seeds offer better protection and nourishment for the embryo than spores, and can remain dormant for long periods until conditions are right for germination. Found in gymnosperms and angiosperms.
    - **Cones:** The reproductive structures of gymnosperms. Male cones produce pollen, and female cones contain ovules that, once fertilized, develop into seeds.
    - **Flowers:** The reproductive structures of angiosperms. They typically contain male parts (stamens, producing pollen) and female parts (carpels/pistils, containing ovules). Flowers are often brightly colored or scented to attract pollinators. After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed, and the ovary (part of the flower) develops into a fruit surrounding the seed.
    
3. **Morphological, Physiological, Phenological Adaptations in Desert Plants**
    - Desert plants face extreme conditions: high temperatures, intense sunlight, and very little water. They have evolved amazing adaptations to survive:
    - **Morphological Adaptations (Structure/Form):**
        - **Reduced leaf surface area:** Small leaves, or leaves modified into spines (like in cacti) to reduce water loss through transpiration.
        - **Thick, waxy cuticle:** A waxy layer on leaves and stems to prevent water loss.
        - **Water storage tissues:** Succulent stems or leaves (e.g., cacti, aloe) to store water.
        - **Extensive root systems:** Either very deep taproots to reach groundwater or wide, shallow networks to quickly absorb rainwater.
        - **Light color or hairy surfaces:** To reflect sunlight and reduce heat absorption.
    - **Physiological Adaptations (Function/Internal Processes):**
        - **CAM Photosynthesis (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism):** Plants open their stomata (pores in leaves for gas exchange) only at night to take in CO2 when it's cooler and more humid, reducing water loss. The CO2 is stored as an acid and then used for photosynthesis during the day when stomata are closed.
        - **Drought tolerance:** Ability to survive extreme dehydration.
        - **Salt tolerance:** Some desert soils are salty.  
    - **Phenological Adaptations (Timing of Life Cycle Events):**
        - **Rapid life cycle:** Some desert annuals ("ephemerals") germinate, grow, flower, and produce seeds very quickly after a rain, completing their life cycle before the soil dries out.
        - **Dormancy:** Many desert plants become dormant during dry periods, reducing metabolic activity to conserve water.
        - **Flowering in response to rain:** Timing reproduction to coincide with water availability.

1. **To create electricity and the flow of electrons there must be an electrical potential difference... This electrical potential difference is known as ____.**
    
    - **a. Voltage**
    - Explanation: Voltage is precisely the electrical potential difference, or "pressure," that causes electrons to flow. Current is the flow itself, and Ampere is the unit of current.
2. **In a coal-based power plant, which of the following materials are reusable?**
    
    - **d. All of the above**
    - Explanation:
        - **Coils of wire** and **Magnet:** These are parts of the generator, which is designed for long-term use and isn't consumed in the process.
        - **Water:** In most power plants, water is heated to steam, spins a turbine, and then is condensed back to water to be reused in a closed loop system.
3. **If a classroom has 10 32-watt CFLs on for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, how much energy do the lights use?**
    
    - **c. 12.8 kwh**
    - Calculation:
        1. Total wattage: 10 lights * 32 watts/light = 320 watts
        2. Total hours per week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours
        3. Energy in watt-hours (Wh): 320 watts * 40 hours = 12,800 Wh
        4. Convert to kilowatt-hours (kWh): 12,800 Wh / 1000 = 12.8 kWh
4. **If an incandescent 100-watt light bulb is left on for 1 week (168 hours), how many watt-hours of energy does it consume?**
    
    - **d. 16800 watt-hours**
    - Calculation: Energy (Wh) = Power (watts) * Time (hours) = 100 watts * 168 hours = 16,800 watt-hours.
5. **If a 25-watt compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb is left on for 1 week (168 hours), how many watt-hours of energy does it consume?**
    
    - **c. 4200 watt-hours**
    - Calculation: Energy (Wh) = Power (watts) * Time (hours) = 25 watts * 168 hours = 4,200 watt-hours.
6. **Based on your answers from 4 and 5, which type of light bulb is most efficient (environmentally friendly)?**
    
    - **b. Compact fluorescent light**
    - Explanation: The CFL bulb uses significantly less energy (4200 Wh) than the incandescent bulb (16800 Wh) to produce the same amount of light (as stated in the problem setup). Less energy use means less environmental impact from electricity generation.

1. **An appliance is used in plug load for 2 hours a day at 200 watts, and it is left in phantom mode for the other 22 hours at 20 watts. How much energy does that appliance use in a day?**
    
    - **c. .84 kwh**
    - Calculation:
        1. Plug load energy: 200 watts * 2 hours = 400 Wh
        2. Phantom load energy: 20 watts * 22 hours = 440 Wh
        3. Total daily energy: 400 Wh + 440 Wh = 840 Wh
        4. Convert to kWh: 840 Wh / 1000 = 0.84 kWh
2. **At which of the following latitudes does the most evaporation take place on earth?**
    
    - **a. 0 degrees**
    - Explanation: The equator (0 degrees latitude) receives the most direct and intense solar radiation throughout the year, leading to higher temperatures and therefore higher rates of evaporation from oceans and other water bodies.
3. **Tropical rainforests are found at what latitude?**
    
    - **a. 0 degrees**
    - Explanation: Tropical rainforests are typically found near the equator (around 0 degrees latitude) in the region of the Hadley cells where warm, moist air rises, cools, and releases large amounts of precipitation.
4. **Air in the northern hemisphere**
    
    - **b. Bends right**
    - Explanation: This is due to the Coriolis effect. Because of Earth's rotation, moving objects (like air masses) are deflected to their right in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere.

**Page 3 (Climatographs)**

Refer to the biome diagram on page 2 to help with these.

1. **Climatograph 1:**
    - Analysis: Temperatures range from cool winters (around 5°C) to warm summers (peaking near 25-30°C). Precipitation is moderate and distributed throughout the year, with a summer peak.
    - Matching to biome chart: This pattern (distinct seasons, moderate temperature, and adequate rainfall) best fits the **Temperate Seasonal Forest** (also known as temperate deciduous forest) on the provided biome chart.
    - **Answer Choice:** Of the options provided (Rainforest, Savanna, Tundra, Boreal forest), none are a perfect match for "Temperate Seasonal Forest."
        - Tundra and Boreal forest are too cold.
        - Savanna (Tropical Seasonal Forest/Savanna on the chart) has consistently higher temperatures (average 20-30°C) and often a more pronounced dry season.
        - "Rainforest" is broad. Tropical rainforests have high temps and very high rain year-round. Temperate rainforests have milder temps and very high rain. This graph's precipitation might be a bit low for a typical "rainforest" designation compared to the chart, and summer temps are a bit high for the "Temperate Rainforest" band on the chart.
        - However, if we must choose the BEST FIT from the given options, and considering the graph shows a forested environment due to sufficient moisture: "Savanna" is a worse fit due to temperature. **a. Rainforest** might be chosen if it's interpreted broadly as a forest type that isn't savanna, tundra, or boreal, even if it's not a perfect representation of a typical "rainforest" climatograph. This is a tricky one given the options and the specific climatograph. The climatograph strongly resembles a Temperate Seasonal Forest. If this option isn't available, "Rainforest" is the least incorrect of the remaining forest types.
2. **Climatograph 2:**
    
    - Analysis: Temperatures show distinct seasons, similar to climatograph 1 (cool winters around 5°C, hot summers around 28°C). However, precipitation is very low year-round (mostly below 5 cm/month).
    - Matching to biome chart: Very low precipitation with this temperature range points to a desert. It fits well within the **Subtropical Desert** or the warmer end of **Temperate Grassland/Desert** on the biome chart.
    - **c. Desert**

1. **T or F: The following image shows the accurate convection cells in the earth's atmosphere:**
    
    - **F (False)**
    - Explanation: The image shows a single large convection cell per hemisphere, with hot air rising at the "Hot" (equator) and sinking at the "Cold" (pole). While this shows the principle of a convection cell, the Earth's atmosphere has a more complex system of three major cells per hemisphere: Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells. So, the depiction of just one large cell per hemisphere is not an accurate representation of the plural "convection cells" in Earth's atmosphere.
2. **Which of the following planets would be least affected by the coriolis effect?**
    
    - **a. Venus**
    - Explanation: The Coriolis effect is dependent on the rotation speed of the planet. Venus rotates extremely slowly (one rotation takes 243 Earth days). Slower rotation means a much weaker Coriolis effect.
3. **Below is a picture of the Big Island of Hawaii. Which location labeled on the image is part of a rain shadow?**
    
    - **d. D** (and C would also be in a rain shadow)
    - Explanation: The prevailing trade winds in Hawaii come from the northeast. As moist air is forced up the mountains (like Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa), it cools and drops rain on the windward (northeastern) side (like area A). The leeward (southwestern) side is sheltered from this moisture and is much drier, forming a rain shadow. Location D (Kona coast) is on the leeward side and is famously sunny and dry. Location C is also on the leeward side. Given the options, D is a classic rain shadow area.

1. **What type of air would you expect to find at 60 degrees latitude?**
    
    - **a. Moist**
    - Explanation: Around 60 degrees latitude (North and South) is the boundary between the Ferrel cells and the Polar cells. Here, warmer air from lower latitudes meets colder polar air. This convergence forces the air to rise. As air rises, it cools, and water vapor condenses, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. Therefore, the air is typically moist and rising.
2. **What plant characteristics and features apply to bryophytes?**
    
    - **b. Spores**
    - Explanation: Bryophytes (like mosses) are early land plants. They are non-vascular (lack true roots, stems, leaves with specialized transport), and they reproduce using spores, not seeds or fruits.
3. **Use the terms to label the parts of the flower.**
    
    - **a. Stigma** (receives pollen)
    - **b. Anther** (produces pollen, part of stamen)
    - **c. Style** (connects stigma to ovary, part of pistil)
    - **d. Filament** (supports anther, part of stamen)
    - **e. Ovule** (develops into a seed)
    - **f. Stem** (or pedicel, supports the flower)
    - **g. Petal** (often colored to attract pollinators)
    - **h. Sepal** (usually green, encloses the bud)
    - **i. Ovary** (contains ovules, develops into fruit, part of pistil)
    - **j. Stamen** (the entire male reproductive part: anther + filament)
    - **k. Pistil** (the entire female reproductive part: stigma + style + ovary)

1. **CAM plants...**
    
    - **d) All of the above**
        
    - Explanation: CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants are well adapted to desert environments (a) because they open their stomata at night to take in CO2 (b), which minimizes water loss during the hot day, thus conserving water (c).
        
2. **What type of tree does this leaf belong to?** (Image of a maple-like leaf)
    
    - **c. Deciduous**
        
    - Explanation: The broad, lobed leaf is characteristic of trees like maples, which are deciduous (they lose their leaves seasonally). Evergreens typically have needles or retain their leaves year-round. Gymnosperms are mostly conifers with needles or scales.
        
3. **Which of the following is true about the tiered rate plan?**
    
    - **a. Tiered rate plans increase after the user surpasses the baseline allowance of energy**
        
    - Explanation: In a tiered rate system, you pay a certain price per unit of energy up to a "baseline" amount. If you use more than that baseline, the price per unit for the additional energy increases, often in steps or "tiers."
        
4. **Which plant trait evolved most recently?**
    
    - **c. Fruit**
        
    - Explanation:
        
        - Spores: Ancient (bryophytes, pteridophytes).
            
        - Vessel Elements & Tracheids: Vascular tissues. Tracheids are older; vessel elements are more advanced and common in angiosperms but also found in some other groups.
            
        - Fruit: A defining characteristic of angiosperms (flowering plants), which are the most recently evolved major group of plants.

1. **Which of the images below most accurately describes how air travels up a mountain?**
    
    - **Mountain (2) Air rises - expands - cools**
        
    - Explanation: As air is forced upward by a mountain, it encounters lower atmospheric pressure. This causes the air to expand. Adiabatic expansion (expansion without heat exchange with the surroundings) causes the air to cool. If it cools to its dew point, condensation occurs, forming clouds and precipitation.
        
2. **On a hot day you leave two containers outside... One is filled with water and the other one is filled with the same volume but of dirt. Which container will be hotter after 5 hours?**
    
    - **b. Dirt**
        
    - Explanation: Dirt (soil) generally has a lower specific heat capacity than water. This means it takes less energy to raise the temperature of dirt by a certain amount compared to water. Therefore, with the same amount of solar energy input, the dirt will heat up faster and reach a higher temperature than the water.

These questions are renumbered 11 and 12, but are separate from the earlier ones.

1. **What process is NOT part of the carbon cycle?**
    
    - **c. infiltration**
        
    - Explanation:
        
        - Photosynthesis: Plants take CO2 from the atmosphere.
            
        - Decomposition: Releases CO2 back to the atmosphere/soil.
            
        - Subduction/plate tectonics: Part of the very long-term geological carbon cycle (carbon stored in rocks can be subducted).
            
        - Infiltration: This is primarily a term for the process of water seeping into the ground, part of the water cycle. While carbon can be dissolved or suspended in that water, infiltration itself isn't a core transformation or flux process of carbon in the same way the others are.
            
2. **Which of the following processes adds carbon dioxide into the atmosphere?**
    
    - **b. Decomposition**
        
    - Explanation:
        
        - Photosynthesis: Removes CO2.
            
        - Decomposition: When organic matter breaks down, microorganisms respire, releasing CO2.
            
        - Sedimentation and Burial: Stores carbon, removing it from the active cycle.
            
        - Diffusion from the air into the ocean: This describes the ocean absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere.

More renumbered questions.

1. **Most of the mass of a tree comes from**
    
    - **c. Air**
        
    - Explanation: Trees are primarily made of cellulose and lignin, which are carbon-based compounds. The carbon atoms come from carbon dioxide (CO2) taken from the air during photosynthesis. Water provides hydrogen and some oxygen, but the bulk of the dry mass is derived from atmospheric CO2.
        
2. **In photosynthesis, for every molecule of glucose that is made, how many molecules of oxygen are made?**
    
    - **d. 6**
        
    - Explanation: The balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is:  
        6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2.  
        So, 6 molecules of oxygen (O2) are produced for every molecule of glucose (C6H12O6).
        
3. **Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is**
    
    - **d. All of the above**
        
    - Explanation:
        
        - a. ATP is the energy currency produced during cellular respiration (which breaks down glucose using oxygen).
            
        - b. It's often described as a "charged battery" due to the high-energy bonds between its three phosphate groups.
            
        - c. It is used by organisms to power almost all cellular activities.
            
4. **Fill in the blanks... Cellular respiration happens in the _________ while photosynthesis happens in the _________ of cells.**
    
    - **b. mitochondria; chloroplasts**
        
    - Explanation: In eukaryotic cells, cellular respiration primarily occurs in the mitochondria. Photosynthesis in plant and algal cells occurs in the chloroplasts.
        
5. **BTB, a pH indicator, is put in the water. Someone then blows bubbles through the straw for one minute. The solution**
    
    - **b. Will turn yellow because the pH of the water decreases**
        
    - Explanation: Exhaled breath contains carbon dioxide (CO2). When CO2 dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which lowers the pH of the water (makes it more acidic). Bromothymol blue (BTB) is yellow in acidic solutions (pH < 6.0), green in neutral solutions, and blue in basic solutions.
        
6. **At what point in the year are carbon dioxide levels LOWEST in the atmosphere?**
    
    - **a. Summer** (or more precisely, late summer/early fall)
        
    - Explanation: This refers to the seasonal cycle seen in the Keeling Curve. During the spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere (which has more landmass and terrestrial vegetation), plants are actively photosynthesizing and drawing down CO2 from the atmosphere. This leads to the lowest atmospheric CO2 concentrations typically occurring at the end of the growing season, around late summer or early fall. "Summer" is the best fit among the options.

1. **Energy enters the earth system as shortwave sunlight and leaves as longwave**
    
    - **b. Heat or infrared**
        
    - Explanation: The Earth absorbs shortwave radiation (like visible light and UV) from the sun. It then re-radiates energy back into space as longwave radiation, which is primarily infrared radiation (heat).
        
2. **There are yearly fluctuations of carbon dioxide levels in Mauna Loa because**
    
    - **a. Earth's seasonal fluctuations determine how much carbon dioxide plants can uptake through photosynthesis**
        
    - Explanation: The primary driver of the annual zigzag pattern in CO2 levels is the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay, especially in the Northern Hemisphere with its larger landmass. During spring and summer, plants take up large amounts of CO2; during fall and winter, respiration and decomposition release CO2.
        
3. **Which of the following statements is true about Flint's water crisis?**
    
    - **c. When Flint changed its water source to the Flint River the pH of the water decreased**
        
    - Explanation: While the Flint water crisis was complex, a key factor was that the Flint River water was more corrosive than the treated Lake Huron water. Corrosive water can be caused by several factors, including lower pH (more acidic), lower alkalinity (less buffering capacity), and high levels of chloride. The failure to add corrosion inhibitors to the Flint River water allowed it to leach lead from pipes. A decrease in pH generally makes water more corrosive to lead pipes.
