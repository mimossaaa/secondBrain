Here are detailed notes on the **Standard English Conventions** that you should know for the SAT:

---

### **1. Sentence Structure**

#### **A. Sentence Boundaries**
   - **Fragments**: A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence. It lacks a subject, verb, or complete thought. 
     - **Example**: “Running through the park.” (Fragment) → “She was running through the park.” (Complete)
   - **Run-on Sentences**: Occurs when two independent clauses are connected without proper punctuation.
     - **Example**: “She ran through the park it was windy.” → “She ran through the park, and it was windy.”

#### **B. Subordination and Coordination**
   - **Subordination**: Connects a dependent clause to an independent clause using subordinating conjunctions (e.g., because, although).
     - **Example**: “Because it was raining, we stayed inside.”
   - **Coordination**: Connects two independent clauses using coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so—FANBOYS).
     - **Example**: “It was raining, but we went outside.”

#### **C. Modifier Placement**
   - **Dangling Modifiers**: A modifier must be next to the word it describes. If not, it creates confusion.
     - **Example**: “While running, the dog barked loudly.” → “While I was running, the dog barked loudly.”
   - **Misplaced Modifiers**: Modifiers need to be placed close to the words they modify to avoid confusion.
     - **Example**: “She almost ate the entire pizza.” → “She ate almost the entire pizza.”

---

### **2. Grammar Usage**

#### **A. Subject-Verb Agreement**
   - The subject and verb must agree in number (singular vs. plural).
     - **Example**: “The dog barks.” (singular) vs. “The dogs bark.” (plural)
   - Watch for tricky subjects: Collective nouns (e.g., team, group) are usually singular.
     - **Example**: “The team is winning.”

#### **B. Pronoun Usage**
   - **Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement**: Pronouns must agree in number and gender with the noun they replace.
     - **Example**: “Each student must bring their book.” → “Each student must bring his or her book.”
   - **Clear Pronoun Reference**: Pronouns must refer to a clear noun (the antecedent).
     - **Example**: “When Lily saw Jane, she waved.” (unclear) → “When Lily saw Jane, Lily waved.”

#### **C. Verb Tense**
   - **Consistent Tense**: Keep the same verb tense within a sentence or passage unless there is a time shift.
     - **Example**: “She studied hard and **is** taking the test tomorrow.” → “She studied hard and **will take** the test tomorrow.”
   - **Irregular Verbs**: Know common irregular verbs and their correct forms (e.g., run → ran → has run; swim → swam → has swum).

#### **D. Pronoun Case**
   - **Subjective Case**: Use subjective pronouns (I, he, she, they) as the subject of a sentence.
     - **Example**: “He went to the store.”
   - **Objective Case**: Use objective pronouns (me, him, her, them) as objects.
     - **Example**: “The teacher gave her the assignment.”
   - **Who vs. Whom**: Use “who” when referring to the subject, and “whom” when referring to the object of a verb or preposition.
     - **Example**: “Who is coming to dinner?” vs. “Whom did you invite?”

---

### **3. Punctuation**

#### **A. Comma Rules**
   - **Lists**: Use commas to separate items in a list.
     - **Example**: “I bought apples, oranges, and bananas.”
   - **Introductory Elements**: Use a comma after an introductory clause or phrase.
     - **Example**: “After dinner, we watched a movie.”
   - **Nonessential Information**: Use commas to set off nonessential information (information that can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence).
     - **Example**: “My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting.”
   - **Conjunctions**: Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) that connects two independent clauses.
     - **Example**: “I wanted to go to the party, but I had homework.”

#### **B. Semicolons**
   - Use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses that are closely related in thought.
     - **Example**: “I have a big test tomorrow; I can’t go out tonight.”
   - Use semicolons to separate items in a list when the items themselves contain commas.
     - **Example**: “I’ve visited Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Berlin, Germany.”

#### **C. Colons**
   - Use a colon to introduce a list or an explanation, but only after a complete sentence.
     - **Example**: “She brought three things to the meeting: a notebook, a pen, and a laptop.”
   - Use a colon to emphasize or introduce a related idea.
     - **Example**: “There’s only one thing left to do: study.”

#### **D. Apostrophes**
   - **Possession**: Use apostrophes to show possession. For singular nouns, add ’s; for plural nouns, add just an apostrophe.
     - **Example**: “The dog’s bone” vs. “The dogs’ bones.”
   - **Contractions**: Use apostrophes in contractions (don’t, can’t, isn’t).
     - **Example**: “It’s raining” (it is) vs. “Its color is blue” (possessive).

---

### **4. Parallel Structure**
   - Items in a list or comparison should follow the same grammatical structure.
     - **Incorrect**: “She likes swimming, to run, and biking.”
     - **Correct**: “She likes swimming, running, and biking.”

---

### **5. Commonly Confused Words**
   - **Their/There/They’re**:
     - **Their**: Possessive (Their house).
     - **There**: Refers to a place (Over there).
     - **They’re**: Contraction of they are (They’re happy).
   - **Its/It’s**:
     - **Its**: Possessive (Its cover).

   - **Effect/Affect**:

     - **Affect**: Verb, to influence (The storm will affect the game).
   - **Than/Then**:
     - **Than**: Comparison (I am taller than you).
     - **Then**: Time or sequence (We ate, then we left).

---

### **6. Redundancy**
   - Avoid repeating ideas unnecessarily.
     - **Incorrect**: “The reason is because she was late.”
     - **Correct**: “The reason is she was late.”

---

### **7. Diction (Word Choice)**
   - Choose the most precise word to convey meaning in context. Avoid overly wordy or vague language.
     - **Incorrect**: “She made a decision to leave quickly.”
     - **Correct**: “She decided to leave quickly.”

---

### **Study Strategy**
- **Practice Editing Passages**: Go through passages and try correcting errors in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.
- **Memorize Grammar Rules**: Make sure you’re familiar with the common rules for punctuation, verb agreement, and pronoun usage.
- **Review Common Mistakes**: Pay special attention to the grammar rules that tend to trip people up, like subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and pronoun clarity.

By mastering these conventions, you'll be able to ace the grammar and editing questions in the SAT Writing section!
