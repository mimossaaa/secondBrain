**5 - Cosmos** ‚úÖ
	Think about the program's main focus, your experience, and what you accomplished and learned while participating in the program. **collaborative research and field experience**
		As part of cluster 8, the wonders of the ocean: from bioluminescence to marine mammals, I stayed for a month on the beautiful UCSC campus. Every day of the week, I would go to a morning lecture along with two classes: marine mammal physiology, and microbiology lab. In class, we learned everything about marine mammals, from Topographic Variations in Mobilization of Blubber, to reading electrocardiograms. In the lab, we worked on colonizing various bacteria, from Ecoli to vibrio fischeri.  I conducted research on the use of microbial microcosms to combat plastic pollution, which essentially means that we were studying plastic-eating bacteria. The research project was done in teams of two, so along with my partner I learned all about the process of biodegradation of plastics in the ocean. Plastics are eroded by the ocean currents and heat of the sun, and eventually become microplastics, when they are colonized by bacteria. My research found that bacteria couldn't be a solution yet, but time will tell.One highlight of the program was the field trips, where we went on small boat surveys over the submarine trench, and conducted necropsies on porpoises. As a part of the program, I gained two major things, the amazing friendships i gaied through hours of meticulous research, and the work ethic i gained from the tense scholastic environmnet.

		What did you do to achieve this award or honor? 
			The award is given to a singular student who demonstrated outstanding artistic ability, along with amazing community building and behavior. In order to win this event, I submitted two paintings, one watercolor and one acrylic. My favorite of the two was titled "Warning" inspired by Ren√© Magritte's The Treachery of Images. It consisted of a black and white painting of a hand violently removed from the body beside a saw. On my second piece depicting a mountain range over a lake I spent over 25 hours on the piece, which combined watercolors and decoupage. I was also judged for my writing about both peices, in which I described my process, mediums, and materials.

			The award is given to one student for artistic excellence and community involvement. I submitted two paintings: "Warning," a black-and-white acrylic inspired by Ren√© Magritte, and a mountain scene over a lake. Both pieces took 25+ hours and combined watercolors and decoupage. I was also judged on my written descriptions of the process and materials used.
