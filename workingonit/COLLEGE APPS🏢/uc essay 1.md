### **1 - Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.**

the best example of my leadership may be my experience as Team captain of the varsity and JV swim teams. Swimming has been a huge part of my life for a while now, ever since I started swimming competitively in sixth grade. With some of the most consistent efforts I've ever made in my life I was able to become a very compettive swimmer dspite my late start. 

The first year I swam with the baboa swim team, 

As the captain, I had many responsiblities. Not only did I need to push myself to prepare for my events, I also needed to push others. I had to assign hard sets to my teammates, knowing it would hurt them. This was hard for me but I knew this was what we needed, even if we didn't want it in the moement. As the captain, meets were times when I was on edge. I made sure everyone would swim their event on time.  Some teammates were easily deflated, and would try to quit just before their event, and my pep talks would have to be on point; clear, concise, and encouraging. I can remember giving 9 pep talks one meet, when the vibes were down. 

Communicating with the coach was also an important aspect of being captain. For whatever reason, Balboa had a hard time finding real swim coaches, and we've been stuck with volleyball and basketball coaches for the past few years. This makes a mutual learning experience, where I communciate what a swim coach looks like, as coach communicates what a team looks like. As the captain, I make sure to show utmost repsect to the coach, setting a precedent for the other teammates that the coach isn't someone to mess with.

I was able to increase the teams numbers from 5 to over 30, making constant efforts to organize friends, advertisiing at the club fair, and promoting through great team dinners

I remember gathering the 20 signatures I needed to start a club in a few days, and it seemed everything would be easy. The first meeting came, and the disaster had started. The overpacked room was chaotic, full of distracted teenagers. But this initial chaos taught me a crucial lesson in leadership: success comes from navigating challenges and uniting people around a shared vision. Over time, we found our footing and began taking on bold projects that shaped not just our club, but also the school community.

overwhlemed by the amount of tasks I had brought on myself, I decided to make one of the best desicone I have ever made. I formed a special group amongst the club called the "core" which consisted of 6 members. I carefully selected the most active students with the help of my club sponsor. Knowing I watend this team to be just like brothers, I organized lots of team bonding, and we went to have fun at museums, eating food, and watching movies on several occasions. I made sure to have one on one converstations with all of the members, so i could really understand them, and they could really understand me. Soon, we were like brothers, just as I wanted and i lead a meeting where we spent time assigning ourselves to roles within the club. I was able to organize the core into roles of managing funds, food, websites, tutoring, and social media. This small but meaningful change, of extraploating my duties to other compotent members, allowed me to have more time to focues on projects and grants.

Specifically, this allowed me to focus on securing one of the most important parts of a project, funding. I was able to write a grant to a local organization, secruing 850 dollars in funding. The process was complicated, and required me to attend many meetings, including one where I presented about our club, and what we were doing with the meeting to the commitee, and other clubs.



As a club leader, I knew that I should take on the hardest tasks head on if I wanted our club to grow. I knew that I should give people individual attention, so that we could all grow as a group, and I knew that setting my own good example would help others follow suit.

In swim team, I used the same lessons, making sure to

But this initial chaos taught me a crucial lesson in leadership: success comes from navigating challenges and uniting people around a shared vision. Over time, we found our footing and began taking on bold projects that shaped not just our club, but also the school community.

One of our boldest projects was "Bal’s Slice of Pi," where we installed news displays around the school, which showed school news. Using Raspberry Pi, we wrote code to display slides remotely, a project funded by an $800 grant from a local organization and $2,000 from the school. The project not only enhanced the school’s tech infrastructure but also brought together different groups of students to work toward a common goal.

As spring swung around, I organized a period of 2 months dedicated to applying to summer research programs. Knowing how life-changing participating in COSMOS was, I wanted my peers to experience this too. The first few weeks were spent explaining the different programs, and we chose SSP and COSMOS. I was able to bring in teachers to help with essay writing, and in May we received the happy news that 3 of our members were accepted into these programs.

Inspired by our club’s success, I organized a math competition for Pi Day, modeled after MIT's Integration Bee. I reached out to a local calculus professor to write problems for us, and the event involved many students as competitors, judges, and volunteers.

My club's journey didn't stop there. After attending the COSMOS summer program, I collaborated with my peers to create the Cosmic Chronicle, a statewide high school club-based science journal. Our journal garnered over 400 individual views and had 20+ articles submitted from students across the state.

These experiences have helped me grow from someone who stayed in the shade to someone who shines, brightening the world for others.

The best example of my leadership is my role as captain of both the varsity and JV swim teams. Swimming has been a major part of my life since I began competitively swimming in sixth grade. Despite my late start, through consistent effort, I became a highly competitive swimmer. As captain, I had numerous responsibilities, including motivating my teammates and ensuring everyone was prepared for their events. Balancing this with my own training was challenging, but necessary.

One memorable meet stands out, where the team’s energy was low, and I delivered nine pep talks to ensure everyone stayed focused. It was also my responsibility to communicate with the coach—Balboa struggled to find actual swim coaches, leaving us with volleyball and basketball coaches instead. This turned into a mutual learning experience: I taught them about swimming, while they shared insights about leadership and teamwork. I also set an example by showing respect, creating an environment where teammates could trust and follow the coach’s guidance. My efforts grew the team from 5 to over 30 swimmers through recruitment and bonding activities like team dinners.

I also demonstrated leadership as the founder of a school club. After gathering the 20 signatures needed to start, our first chaotic meeting taught me that success doesn’t come easy—it requires uniting people around a shared vision. Realizing I was overwhelmed by tasks, I formed a “core” group of six dedicated members. We bonded over outings and built trust, allowing me to delegate responsibilities like managing funds, tutoring, and social media.

This structure enabled me to focus on writing grants, including one that secured $850 in funding. The process was complex, requiring presentations and meetings with local organizations, but it taught me how to take on difficult tasks for the benefit of the group. Leadership, I learned, is about guiding others, delegating, and setting the example for the team to follow.

As the captain of the varsity swim team at Balboa HS, I played a key role to make our team more competitive in the citywide meet. I started to swim competitively in sixth grade, and although that is considered a late start, I’ve applied consistent effort to become a highly competitive swimmer. For my school team, I’ve been able to contribute by motivating my teammates, and helping everyone on the team prepare for individual events. As a club swimmer, I’ve learned the importance of warming up and cooling down at the right times during a swim meet, and I managed to share that knowledge with swimmers on my school team, especially because most of them do not have swim club experience. Since my school does not have a tradition of strong swim teams, we don’t have an experienced coach, and instead the athletic director takes on the role of swim coach. For that reason, I needed to step in to run the practices, write out the training sets, and take on a much bigger role than I originally intended. I really enjoy swimming, so I was able to explain time intervals to beginners in a way they could understand, and my efforts to support the team, which included organizing team dinners, led our team to grow from 5 swimmers to over 30 swimmers.

I started swimming very late. Majority of competitive swimmer swim their entire lives, but I only started in middle school, and it wasn't easy. I was always swimming in lanes with much younger kids, and was ashamed of my age. I tried to focus in my training, and I was able to grow faster than my teammates, and after many years, I was able to catch up. Even so, swimming was always a place where I felt socially smaller, things like being the only Algerian in a white/Chinese dominated space, and my asthma breaks still made me feel weaker. Despite being a strong leader at school and at work, I never felt like it would spill over to my athletics. 

This all changed my sophomore year, when I was invited to swim on the team by a PE teacher. All it took was the first practice, and the senior captain, who was the only other competitive swimmer, realized that my skills were going to be a huge asset. He propped me up, and wanted me to be a captain with him. His confidence helped me immeasurably, and I felt ready to lead. 

After helping him for a year, he graduated, and the responsibilities all fell on me for next year. At practice, I made sure to come 15 minuites early, making a set, and setting the lane lines up in the pool. I learned how to make tough descions, like forcing my teammates to swim difficult sets, even if they all complained, I had to stand firm, and remind them we needed this. Lots of our swimmers didn't swim club, and I had to spend lots of time helping them at meets. They were easily deflated on meet days, and I remember delivering 9 pep talks to discouraged teammates. After meets ended, I would always lose my voice, having chanted for all of my teammates, and yelled

As the captain, I also had to work closely with the coach. Unfortunately, my school does not have a tradition of strong swim teams, and since we don’t have an experienced coach. I had to step up and talk to referees and timers, explaining all of the technical swimming language to the coach. At the same time, the coach’s inexperience had many swimmers insulting them, so I made sure, as the captain, to show utmost respect to the coach, setting a precedent for the other teammates that the coach isn't someone to mess with. I grew with the coach, and as I communicate what a swim coach looks like, the coach would tell me what a captain looks like.
