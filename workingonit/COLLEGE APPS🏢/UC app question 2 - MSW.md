My relationship with museums has never been relaxed. My mom always tells me how she brought me to the local Cal academy, exploratorium, asian art museum , SF MOMA, so she could grow my mind from early on. Her efforts paid off, and she instilled a deep love for museums within me.

This love for museums naturally led me to my work as an exhibit technician at the Mission Science Workshop. I've worked for the past two and a half years, maintaining 20 exhibits, and designing over 10.

Great designs require great tools, and I've used everything from table saws, drill presses, and soldering iron to bring my ideas to life. I've also applied microcontrollers like Arduino into my projects, and used 3d printers to realize my designs made in Solidworks, Fusion360 and onshape.

One of my favorite projects is my Touch-Me Terrarium. It features the yellow-spotted millipede with its unique hydrogen cyanide defense. It is full of flora and fauna collected while camping in Muir Woods last summer, where I meticulously while exploring off trail in the foggy redwood forest. To maintain the terrarium while interning abroad, I designed an Arduino system that measured soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, automatically watering it as needed. I crafted a terrarium mimicking the redwood floor, complete with isopods and ferns, blending my fascination with nature and creativity in exhibit design. 

From the 10 exhibits I've designed, the visitors are most fond of my aquaponics setup, which I designed in the winter of last year.  I was obsessed with growing water plants at this point in my life, and needed a place to put the overflow of pothos and sweet potato I was growing at home. After having been donated various tanks, I decided a perfect opportunity to put them to use was to create some beautiful aquaponics. I set out, grabbing my tape measure, pencil and notebook, making sure I had a perfect third angle view of the tank before designing the housing for the pots, 
I was able to house 10 different plants, with 5 different species, all growing under a grow light, controlled by an Arduino powered timer. After a few months, the roots spread all throughout the tank, and I put zebrafish in the tank, who loved to use the roots as shelter, and occasionally, a playground.

Whether navigating a redwood forest for millipedes or translating botanical knowledge across languages, I harness creativity to make science accessible and engaging. However, I’ve learned to balance my excitement with clarity. My initial tessellation exhibit overwhelmed visitors with technical details, so I simplified the content, ensuring it resonated with a broader audience. By blending scientific curiosity with clear communication, I aim to inspire others to see the world with the same wonder I do.

My relationship with museums began early, thanks to my mom taking me to places like the Cal Academy, Exploratorium, and SF MOMA. This upbringing sparked a deep love for museums, which naturally led to my work as an exhibit technician at the Mission Science Workshop, where I’ve spent the past two and a half years maintaining 20 exhibits and designing over 10.

One of my favorite projects is the "Touch-Me Terrarium," which showcases the yellow-spotted millipede and flora I collected from Muir Woods. To maintain it remotely while interning abroad, I developed an Arduino-based system to monitor soil moisture and humidity, automating the watering process. This project combined my love for nature with creativity in exhibit design.

Another challenging yet rewarding project was a skull guessing game. I transformed a disorganized skull section into an interactive exhibit using an Arduino to display questions and collect answers via a keypad. The hardest part was writing the software in C++, but inspiration from the MS DOS game "Drug Wars" helped me create a system that engages visitors and evaluates their guesses. Eventually, I upgraded the hardware to an ESP32 for remote tracking, and the exhibit became a favorite among visitors.

Throughout my work, I’ve learned that creativity in science is not just about building; it’s also about clear communication. For example, I simplified my initial tessellation exhibit to ensure it resonated with a broader audience. Whether I'm designing an exhibit, exploring a redwood forest, or translating complex ideas, my goal is to make science accessible and engaging for all.

My relationship with museums has always been dynamic, thanks to my mom who regularly took me to places like the Cal Academy and SF MOMA. Her efforts instilled a deep love for museums, leading me to work as an exhibit technician at the Mission Science Workshop.

For the past two and a half years, I've maintained 20 exhibits and designed over 10, using tools like table saws, soldering irons, and microcontrollers like Arduino. One of my favorite projects is the “Touch-Me Terrarium,” featuring the yellow-spotted millipede and flora I collected in Muir Woods. To maintain it while interning abroad, I designed an Arduino system to monitor soil moisture and automatically water the plants.

Among the exhibits I’ve designed, visitors are especially fond of my aquaponics setup. Inspired by my love for water plants, I created an exhibit housing 10 plants, five species, and zebrafish, all under a grow light controlled by an Arduino timer. Watching the tank evolve over months—plants growing, fish interacting with the roots—was a testament to the magic of merging nature with technology.

Another challenging project was a skull guessing game. I transformed a neglected skull section into an interactive experience, using an Arduino to display questions and collect answers via a keypad. Though building the hardware was tough, programming the game in C++ proved even more difficult. I found inspiration in classic games like “Drug Wars,” and eventually upgraded to an ESP32 for remote tracking. The exhibit has since become a hit.

Through these projects, I’ve learned that creativity in science is as much about communicating ideas as it is about building them. I strive to make science accessible and engaging, combining technical skill with my fascination for the natural world.
