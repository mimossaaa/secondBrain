I'm a high schooler workin on writing a college essay for the university of california. I'm curretly answering the prompt :

2 - Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.

I have the following text, and want you to combind it in less than 350 words.

My relationship with museums has never been relaxed. My mom always tells me how she brought me to the local Cal academy, exploratorium, asian art museum , SF MOMA, so she could grow my mind from early on. Her efforts paid off, and she instilled a deep love for museums within me.


This love for museums naturally led me to my work as an exhibit technician at the Mission Science Workshop. I've worked for the past two and a half years, maintaining 20 exhibits, and designing over 10.

Great designs require great tools, and I've used everything from table saws, drill presses, and soldering iron to bring my ideas to life. I've also applied microcontrollers like Arduino into my projects, and used 3d printers to realize my designs made in Solidworks, Fusion360 and onshape.

One of my favorite projects is my Touch-Me Terrarium. It features the yellow-spotted millipede with its unique hydrogen cyanide defense. It is full of flora and fauna collected while camping in Muir Woods last summer, where I meticulously while exploring off trail in the foggy redwood forest. To maintain the terrarium while interning abroad, I designed an Arduino system that measured soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, automatically watering it as needed. I crafted a terrarium mimicking the redwood floor, complete with isopods and ferns, blending my fascination with nature and creativity in exhibit design. 





	The most challenging exhibit I've designed is a skull guessing game. There was a large section of our exhibit dedicated to skeletons, and skulls of various animals. However, the section dedicated to skulls was very disorganized, and neglected by all of the exhibit staff, including myself. Last summer, I put my longer hours to use, and started to clean this section up. I started by cleaning the section up, packing tons of skulls away, to highlight our best ones. I didn't just want to organize it, however, I also wanted to create a ingenious exhibit, with the space i cleared up.

	I wanted to build a game that would allow visitors to guess which animals skulls belonged to. I decided to make the game exists in the physical world, using the skulls we had in the museum, and connecting an arduino to display questions on a screen while taking in answers with a keypad.

	I started building the game by getting a long 2x4 and organizing the skulls on it, marking where i would cut it with a tablesaw. I used the rest of it to create stands, drilling them on the edges of the 2x4 so it would stand like a table. I attached all of the skulls unto the "table" with carefully hidden wire, threaded through holes I drilled into the wood. I started working on the elctronics, connecting an arduino with a keypad, lcd, and 8 differrent leds. The hardware was difficult, but the real challange of the project was the software. Working on the arduino program was a nightmare. Despite my experience with C++, it was difficult to create this program that would change modes, collect data, and interact with users. In a moment of genius, I used code inspired by the famous MS DOS game "Drug wars" to create a system which asked questions, gave answers, and evaluated user input. The game ammased many plays almost every day, and i continued to improve the hardware and software, eventually switching the arduino out for a faster esp32 which allowed me to track data from the game remotley.
	
	
	Whether navigating a redwood forest for millipedes or translating botanical knowledge across languages, I harness creativity to make science accessible and engaging. However, Iâ€™ve learned to balance my excitement with clarity. My initial tessellation exhibit overwhelmed visitors with technical details, so I simplified the content, ensuring it resonated with a broader audience. By blending scientific curiosity with clear communication, I aim to inspire others to see the world with the same wonder I do.

My creativity is expressed when I design terrariums. I initially became interested during my astrophysics phase when I was in middle school, thinking it was the most viable method of interstellar travel. When high school started, fiding myself with extra time, I decided to dedicate it to creating those terrariums I thought were so cool some years ago. When I started making terrariums, they were poor jobs, lasting less than a week without molding. I didn;t understand the concepts of creagina a water cycle, or oxegen renewal
