### UC essay ✍️


**1 - Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.**
	[[uc essay 1]]
	If you had seen me anywhere from 3rd to 9th grade, you wouldn't have seen a leader. I wasn’t the loudest in the room or the one organizing games. I mostly stuck to my small circle. In middle school, I started acting out for laughs and ended up in the principal’s office often. My parents had planned to send me to Lowell, the top high school in the city, but my middle school behavior landed me at John O’Connell HS, a school notorious for its troubled environment. After my parents pushed for a transfer, I ended up at Balboa High. Arriving in the middle of freshman year, I found it hard to fit in, again retreating to my comfort zone. However, in sophomore year, I had an idea: I could start a club. The idea evolved from a simple food club to the Brain Food Society, a STEM club inspired by the Royal Society and Tammany Hall. In this role, I discovered leadership qualities I never thought I had. I guided our club to tackle various projects, hold events, and work together. One of our boldest projects was "Bal’s Slice of Pi," a school improvement project where we installed displays around the school. Using Raspberry pi's we wrote code to display slides remotely, a project funded by an $800 grant from a local organization and $2,000 from the school. The project not only enhanced the school’s tech infrastructure but also brought together different groups of students to work toward a common goal. Inspired by our club’s success, I organized a math competition for Pi Day, modeled after MIT's Integration Bee. I reached out to a local calculus professor to write problems for us, and the event involved many students as competitors, judges, and volunteers. My club's journey didn't stop there—After attending the summer program COSMOS, I collaborated with my peer to create the Cosmic Chronicle, a science journal with a network of several clubs submitting articles to the journal, from San Francisco to Irvine. Our journal was able to garner over 400 individual views, and have 20+ articles submitted. These experiences have helped me grow from someone who stayed in the shade to someone who shines, brightening the world for others.

**2 - Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.**

	My relationship with museums has never been relaxed. My mom always tells me how she brought me to the local Cal academy, exploratorium, asian art museum , SF MOMA, so she could grow my mind from early on. Her efforts paid off, and she instilled a deep love for museums within me. 
	-
	This love for museums naturally led me to my work as an exhibit technician at the Mission Science Workshop, where I’ve worked for the past two and a half years
	-
	I've worked for the past two and a half years, maintaining 20 exhibits, and designing over 10.

	One of my favorite projects is my Touch-Me Terrarium. It features the yellow-spotted millipede with its unique hydrogen cyanide defense. It is full of flora and fauna collected while camping in Muir Woods last summer, where I meticulously while exploring off trail in the foggy redwood forest. To maintain the terrarium while interning abroad, I designed an Arduino system that measured soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, automatically watering it as needed. I crafted a terrarium mimicking the redwood floor, complete with isopods and ferns, blending my fascination with nature and creativity in exhibit design. 
	-
	From the 10 museums I've designed, the visitors are most fond of my aquaponics setup, which I designed in the winter of last year.  I was obsessed with growing water plants at this point in my life, and needed a place to put the overflow of pothos and sweet potato I was growing at home. After having been donated various tanks, I decided a perfect opportunity to put them to use was to create some beautiful aquaponics. 
	-
	I set out, grabbing my tape measure, pencil and notebook, making sure I had a perfect thirdangle view of the tank before designing the housing for the pots, 
	-
	I was able to house 10 different plants, with 5 different species, all growing under a grow light. After a few months, the roots spread all throughout the tank, and I put zebrafish in the tank, who loved to use the roots as shelter, and occasionally, a playground.
	-
	The most challenging exhibit I've designed is a skull guessing game. There was a large section of our exhibit dedicated to skeletons, and skulls of various animals. However, the section dedicated to skulls was very disorganized, and neglected by all of the exhibit staff, including myself. Last summer, I put my longer hours to use, and started to clean this section up. I started by cleaning the section up, packing tons of skulls away, to highlight our best ones. I didn't just want to organize it, however, I also wanted to create a ingenious exhibit, with the space i cleared up.
	-
	I wanted to build a game that would allow visitors to guess which animals skulls belonged to. I decided to make the game exists in the physical world, using the skulls we had in the museum, and connecting an arduino to display questions on a screen while taking in answers with a keypad.
	-
	I started building the game by getting a long 2x4 and organizing the skulls on it, marking where i would cut it with a tablesaw. I used the rest of it to create stands, drilling them on the edges of the 2x4 so it would stand like a table. I attached all of the skulls unto the "table" with carefully hidden wire, threaded through holes I drilled into the wood. I started working on the elctronics, connecting an arduino with a keypad, lcd, and 8 differrent leds. The hardware was difficult, but the real challange of the project was the software. Working on the arduino program was a nightmare. Despite my experience with C++, it was difficult to create this program that would change modes, collect data, and interact with users. In a moment of genius, I used code inspired by the famous MS DOS game "Drug wars" to create a system which asked questions, gave answers, and evaluated user input. The game ammased many plays almost every day, and i continued to improve the hardware and software, eventually switching the arduino out for a faster esp32 which allowed me to track data from the game remotley.
	-
	My museum journey extended internationally when I interned as a trilingual tour guide at the Seoul Botanic Park. I led tours in Korean, French, and English, studying over 40 plants and ten botanical concepts to share with visitors. I interacted with plants and people from around the world, and got to meet my favorite plants, the bottle tree and victoria lily. 
	Whether navigating a redwood forest for millipedes or translating botanical knowledge across languages, I harness creativity to make science accessible and engaging. However, I’ve learned to balance my excitement with clarity. My initial tessellation exhibit overwhelmed visitors with technical details, so I simplified the content, ensuring it resonated with a broader audience. By blending scientific curiosity with clear communication, I aim to inspire others to see the world with the same wonder I do.

**3 - What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?**
	One skill I've mastered is science communication. No matter the complexity or depth of a topic, I can explain it to any age, expertise, or experience.
	-
	Having two little siblings, my entire life I've been explaining all the science I loved to them. When I went through my obsession with astrophysics as a 9 year old, I would sit down my little sister and teach her about nutron stars, pertending to be neil degrasse tyson. When I dove into rainforest biology in middle school, It was both of my siblings that had to hear about it every chanve I got. My faily is a very talkative one, and whenever we get in the car, or eat dinner, we always have conversations. Unless my parents had something super important to talk about, I always wanted to talk about science, and the new things I learned that day. Wether I was explaining the sleeping beauty paradox, or deep sea gigantism, I was always able to have an audience, even though they may not have been paying attention, these conversations grew my love and skill for explaining science.
	-
	My skills materialized first when explaining my research at a symposium at the summer research program COSMOS. I had conducted research on on the use of microbial microcosms to combat plastic pollution, which essentially means that we were studying plastic-eating bacteria. I created a poster on my research, which I had to explain to many students and profeesers during a 2 hour symposium session. This first experience went beautifully, and I felt like I could do what I did at home to others, especially others who were well versed in science. Depite my sucsess, I still had some areas I wanted to improve in. It

	I think the summer of 23 was the most transformative time of my life. I felt so lost during sophomore year, and had no idea what my life trajectory entailed. felt dry, without passion, interest, or motivation.
	-

**5 - Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?**
	Living in the excelsior has been the greatest challenge I have faced. It's been a huge limiting factor to my life in stem, and prevented me from taking classes. I've always been extremely stem passionate and knew I wanted to work as a research scientist, but my high school worked directly against that. My biology and chemistry classes lacked labs, and the coursework was so light that I could get A's without studying. 
	-
	The schools in SFUSD are designed around getting everyone to pass, making the coursework so weak that people that show up half the time can get B's.  Since the coursework is designed to serve the lowest performing students, it's left interested and invested students like me in the dust. Along with this, the absence of AP's at my school has been 
	-
	Knowing how limiting my school was, I knew I needed to seek opportunities to fill the void. last last summer I had the chance to participate in a residential summer program for high school scholars called COSMOS, and so I lived for four weeks like a college student at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Attending this summer program was one of the best experiences of my young life, as I learned many things as a member of the cluster called Wonders of the Ocean: From Bioluminescence to Marine mammals. During the four weeks I took two college courses, and I conducted research on the use of microbial microcosms to combat plastic pollution, which essentially means that we were studying plastic-eating bacteria. The research project was done in teams of two, so along with my partner I learned all about the process of biodegradation of plastics in the ocean. Plastics are eroded by the ocean currents and heat of the sun, and eventually become microplastics, when they are colonized by bacteria. My research found that bacteria couldn't be a solution yet, but time will tell.

**6 - Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.**

**7 - What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?**
	The best example of my leadership is my role as captain of both the varsity and JV swim teams. Swimming has been a major part of my life since I began competitively swimming in sixth grade. Despite my late start, through consistent effort, I became a highly competitive swimmer. As captain, I had numerous responsibilities, including motivating my teammates and ensuring everyone was prepared for their events. Balancing this with my own training was challenging, but necessary.
	One memorable meet stands out, where the team’s energy was low, and I delivered nine pep talks to ensure everyone stayed focused. It was also my responsibility to communicate with the coach—Balboa struggled to find actual swim coaches, leaving us with volleyball and basketball coaches instead. This turned into a mutual learning experience: I taught them about swimming, while they shared insights about leadership and teamwork. I also set an example by showing respect, creating an environment where teammates could trust and follow the coach’s guidance. My efforts grew the team from 5 to over 30 swimmers through recruitment and bonding activities like team dinners.
	I also demonstrated leadership as the founder of a school club. After gathering the 20 signatures needed to start, our first chaotic meeting taught me that success doesn’t come easy—it requires uniting people around a shared vision. Realizing I was overwhelmed by tasks, I formed a “core” group of six dedicated members. We bonded over outings and built trust, allowing me to delegate responsibilities like managing funds, tutoring, and social media.
	This structure enabled me to focus on writing grants, including one that secured $850 in funding. The process was complex, requiring presentations and meetings with local organizations, but it taught me how to take on difficult tasks for the benefit of the group. Leadership, I learned, is about guiding others, delegating, and setting the example for the team to follow.

Every day of the week, I would go to a morning lecture along with two classes: marine mammal physiology, and microbiology lab. In class, we learned everything about marine mammals, from Topographic Variations in Mobilization of Blubber, to reading electrocardiograms. In the lab, we worked on colonizing various bacteria, from Ecoli to vibrio fischeri.  I conducted research on the use of microbial microcosms to combat plastic pollution, which essentially means that we were studying plastic-eating bacteria. The research project was done in teams of two, so along with my partner I learned all about the process of biodegradation of plastics in the ocean.

- My Grandpa’s name was Kim Seok Bong. He lived in Korea until his 40’s after which he immigrated to the US. He worked as a gardener landscaping people’s yards, using what he learned from his life as a construction worker and farmer to make a living. Before his tragic passing 5 years ago, he had many things he would often tell me.  His favroite among these was to never kill, wether it was an ant or an elephant, but rather to let live, and to grow. Those words have rooted themselves deep within me, shaping not only how I view the world but how I choose to live in it. Following his creed, I've dedicated myself to studying life, everything from miniscule bacteria to giant pothos plants. My Biology jeourny took me to UCSC last year, where I participated in the COSMOS program, taking two college courses, Marine Mammal Physiology, and microbiology. In the program, I researched the use of microbial microcosms to combat plastic pollution, which essentially means that we were studying plastic-eating bacteria.

  Just a few months ago, I was able work as a foriegn languange specialist at the Seoul botanical park. The park is one of the largest in asia, being over 70 feet long, complete with a lake, river, greenhouses, and labs. I led tours in Korean, French, and English, studying over 40 plants and ten botanical concepts to share with visitors. I interacted with plants and people from around the world, and got to meet my favorite plants, the bottle tree and victoria lily. I also helped translate documents to English and French created an English and French script for future language specialists.  Curated children's garden curriculum using content from 10 different western botanical gardens. As part of my time, I needed to learn about over 40 plants, and more botanical concepts. Thanks to my studies, howeveer, I was able to see some grail plants. I was able to stand on a victoria lily, just like the images I saw of biologists in books. Working at the botanic park I also had to learn all about their nursery and greenhouse facilities, where I was taught to use the different machinery, such as the soil mixer, shade control, and airflow control.

  My grandfather, Kim Seok Bong, immigrated to the U.S. after spending his early life in Korea as a construction worker and farmer. He became a gardener, transforming people's yards with the knowledge he gained through his experiences. Before his passing five years ago, he often shared life lessons with me, the most memorable being: "Never kill, whether it’s an ant or an elephant. Let things live and grow." This simple but profound philosophy rooted itself deeply in my worldview, guiding me toward a fascination with life—from bacteria to towering plants.

	This journey led me to UCSC, where I studied the biodegradation of plastics using bacteria in at COSMOS. The experience expanded my understanding of life at a microscopic scale, but it also fueled my passion for larger organisms. Most recently, I worked at the Seoul Botanic Park, where I immersed myself in botany, leading multilingual tours and studying over 40 plants. I had the opportunity to interact with the bottle tree and even stand on a Victoria lily, an unforgettable moment that brought my childhood fascination with plants to life. Whether in a lab or a greenhouse, I am driven by the desire to explore, nurture, and let life grow.

    After immigrating to the US, mt gradntafther Kim Seok Bong his lifestyle changed dramatically. He abandoned his life as a construction worker and farmer, Becoming a gadter. Working as a manager during a time in Korea where development was all the hype, he stayed just and rejected permits that were unsafe. Trying to work for safety unlike his coworkers, he was pressured out of the company, and found the only option to be immigrating to the US.

	Until my sister started middle school, I had my own room. It was my domain, but in a moment of kind insanity, I gave it up to my sister so she could have more privacy, rather than sharing with my little brother. Once I moved in with my brother, regret started to settle in. Being 6 years older than him, our sleep times were very different. I had to stay in the room studying while my brother slept. This posed many challagend, as my brother complaied he couldn't sleep with me studying in the room. This wasn't the only problem that arose. Space was soon an issue in our cramped SF apartment, and my plethora of books, plants and tools needed an organization overhaul. A few weekends later, I worked on a set of designs to help solve these problems, which I was able to realize in over time. Organizing my room became a huge part of my life. With an overflow of pliers, soldering irons, and arduino compneents I wsa in need of ogranization.

	I designed most furnitire with wood, which allowed me to tailor furniture exactly to my needs. My first designs were horrible, I mixed woods, and it gave a horrible look to the furniture. The woods were poorly sanded, often giving me splinters, and the boxes and shelves I designed were all slanted. As i kept working at my desgins at a local woodshop, I quickly became a pro. I grew from cutting my wood with handheld saws, to using bandsaws, to using table saws. I used to be undable to differenecaite woods, but now I know cherry from cedar, to redwood, to spruce. I've been able to grow, increasing my strucutral integrity, and the beauty of my furniture, utalizing techniques like inlays to write my name into my furniture.  I've learned how to progress through sandpaper grades, finish wood, making wood joints with dominoes and pegs. My designs started out with simple boxes to organize shelves, and now I've built hanging gardens for my room, and created my own shelves to house plants, books and even a 3d printer.

	When my sister started middle school, I made a selfless decision to give up my room so she could have more privacy, sharing a room with my younger brother instead. At first, I didn’t realize the challenges this would create. Being six years older, our sleep schedules didn’t match, and my late-night study sessions kept him awake. Our cramped San Francisco apartment soon became cluttered with my books, plants, and tools, which needed an organizational overhaul. I spent several weekends designing solutions to optimize the small space, blending function and aesthetics to tackle the issue.

	Initially, my furniture designs were far from perfect. I mixed wood types that clashed, and my poorly sanded creations left me with splinters. However, I persisted. As I spent more time at a local woodshop, I quickly honed my skills, moving from hand saws to band saws, and learning the subtle differences between cherry, cedar, and redwood. My craftsmanship improved as I mastered techniques like inlays, wood joints, and finishing. What started as basic shelving units for organization has evolved into more complex projects like hanging gardens and custom furniture to store everything from plants to my 3D printer. Through trial and error, I’ve transformed from a novice designer into a skilled woodworker, creating solutions that merge form and function in my personal space.

	Creating terrariums is my favorite hobby, and it brings me pure joy by merging my love for science, art, and nature into beautiful, self-sustaining ecosystems. My journey started in middle school when I became fascinated by astrophysics and read "The Martian." This inspired me to think of terrariums as models for interstellar habitats. My first attempts were disheartening, as mold quickly invaded my creations. However, those failures fueled my passion to experiment and innovate. 
	Through trial and error, I discovered the perfect substrate made of worm castings, activated charcoal, and dirt, which nurtured thriving plant life. Collecting materials during my adventures in Northern California’s forests is a highlight of the process. There’s something magical about walking among the trees, gathering twigs and moss, and feeling the untapped energy around me. 
	As I assemble my terrariums using the rule of thirds for design, I experience a deep sense of fulfillment. One of my proudest moments was creating a Touch-Me Terrarium exhibit featuring the dusky Jefferson Salamander. This hobby not only fuels my creativity but also inspires my dream of becoming a plant biologist.
