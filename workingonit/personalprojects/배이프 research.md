		"Exhaled e-cigarette aerosols have also been reported to consist of fine and ultrafine “particles” of particulate matter12,13; however, the term “particle” does not distinguish between solid particles (eg, those emitted from fuel combustion in engines or furnaces) and liquid droplets. Exhaled e-cigarette “particles” have been shown to be liquid droplets primarily composed of propylene glycol, glycerol, and water which condense into a visible mist on exhalation.12,14,15 In a small 8 m3 experimental chamber, the rapidly changing nature of exhaled e-cigarette aerosol droplets has been observed.6 Moreover, following release of e-cigarette aerosols into a larger experimental chamber, droplets in the range 20–300 nm have been recorded, reaching a peak concentration from 103 to 106 particles/cm3,6,16 depending on the generation of tested device, temporal resolution of measurement, ventilation pattern, and other parameters. The short half-life of e-cigarette aerosols in ambient air has been reported to be around 10 seconds (ie, >100 times faster than conventional cigarette smoke) due to the rapid evaporation of liquid droplets at room temperature.12,17"

Metal Oxide sensors
	### **Basic Principle:**

MOX gas sensors detect gases through a chemical reaction that occurs on the surface of a metal oxide (usually tin dioxide, SnO₂) when exposed to a target gas.

### **How it Works:**

1. **Sensing Layer:**
    
    - The sensor has a thin film of metal oxide on a heated substrate.
    - In the presence of oxygen in the air, oxygen molecules adsorb onto the surface of the metal oxide, capturing free electrons from the material and creating an electron depletion layer.
2. **Exposure to Gas:**
    
    - When a target gas (like CO, NOx, or VOCs) comes into contact with the sensing layer, it interacts with the adsorbed oxygen.
    - The gas either reacts with the oxygen molecules or directly with the metal oxide, releasing the trapped electrons back into the material.
3. **Change in Resistance:**
    
    - The release of electrons reduces the electron depletion layer, leading to an increase in the conductivity of the sensor.
    - This change in conductivity (or resistance) is measured by the sensor's electronics.
4. **Signal Output:**
    
    - The sensor converts the change in resistance into an electrical signal that corresponds to the concentration of the target gas.
    - The sensor's output is typically a voltage or current that can be read and interpreted by a microcontroller or other processing device.

### **Factors Affecting Performance:**

- **Operating Temperature:** The sensor’s heater maintains a specific temperature, crucial for the optimal operation of the metal oxide reaction.
- **Humidity and Cross-Sensitivity:** MOX sensors can be affected by humidity and other gases, leading to cross-sensitivity.

### **Applications:**

MOX gas sensors are used in air quality monitoring, industrial safety, and consumer electronics (like air purifiers).

In summary, MOX sensors detect gases by monitoring the change in electrical resistance caused by chemical reactions on the surface of a metal oxide when exposed to a target gas.
