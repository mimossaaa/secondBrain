page overview
	1
		The page introduces the greenhouse tour, focusing on tropical and Mediterranean climates and plant survival strategies.
	2
		This page explains the tropical climate's intense sunlight and its impact on plant growth and moisture transpiration.
	3
		This page describes the rich biodiversity and dense forest structure of tropical rainforests, noting that only 2% of sunlight reaches the ground.
	4
		This page explains why trees grow taller to get more sunlight and introduces epiphytes, like staghorn ferns and bat orchids, which live attached to trees or rocks.
		이 페이지는 나무가 햇빛을 더 많이 받기 위해 자라는 이유와 박쥐란 같은 착생식물이 공중에 노출된 뿌리로 생존하는 방법을 설명합니다.
	5
		This page describes how Skin Dapsus uses aerial roots to cling and absorb moisture, allowing it to grow upward despite its weak stem.
	6
		This page highlights various vines and introduces Nepenthes, a carnivorous plant with insect-trapping features.
	7
		This page explains how Nepenthes traps and digests insects using surfactants and describes its role in nutrient acquisition.
		This page explains the crucial relationship the Nepenthes and the lowii, which involves poop.
	8
		This page describes the Victoria Amazonica water lily’s buoyancy due to its styrofoam-like leaf structure and its gender-changing flowers to avoid self-fertilization.
	9
		This page explains how Monstera flowers use bracts to attract pollinators and describes aerial roots in Angel Skindapsus and Philodendron Selloum.
	10
		This page describes how the Cuban giant palm tree adapts by growing new leaves for sunlight and the challenges of its vine's aerial roots trying to defy gravity.
	11
		This page introduces cacao, used for chocolate, and transitions to discussing the Mediterranean climate, noting its similarities to Korea's climate.
	12
		This page explains how Mediterranean plants, like succulents and cacti, conserve water and adapt to dry conditions by reducing leaves and modifying their stems for photosynthesis.
	13
		This page compares the minimal water loss of cacti to tropical trees and highlights Agave americana's rare blooming cycle.
	14
		This page explains Agave americana’s large flowers, its uses for making agave syrup and tequila, and the importance of precise leaf cutting in tequila production.
	15
		This page introduces the baobab tree, highlighting its species variations, longevity, and adaptation to dry seasons.
	16
		This page discusses the baobab's deep roots for water, its longevity, and the impact of climate change on its survival, highlighting the endangered status of many baobab species.
	17
		This final page emphasizes the difficulty of importing endangered species like the Grandidier baobab and encourages reflection and action on global environmental issues.
