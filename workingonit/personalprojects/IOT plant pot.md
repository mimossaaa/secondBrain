	I'm an engineer working on designing a 3d printed internet of things plant pot. I want to be able to include many sensors in the 3d design. 


### SENSORS

1. **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures the water content in the soil, helping to monitor when to water the plants.
   - Example: Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor.

2. **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors the ambient temperature around the plant, crucial for temperature-sensitive plants.
   - Example: DHT22 (temperature and humidity sensor).

3. **Humidity Sensor**: Measures the air's humidity levels, which affect plant growth, especially for humidity-sensitive plants like ferns.
   - Example: DHT22 or AM2302.

4. **Light Sensor**: Detects the amount of light the plant is receiving, helping to track if it gets enough sunlight or artificial light.
   - Example: BH1750 Light Intensity Sensor.

5. **pH Sensor**: Monitors soil pH, helping maintain optimal growing conditions for different plant types.
   - Example: SEN0169 pH sensor.

6. **CO2 Sensor**: Measures the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, essential for plant photosynthesis.
   - Example: MH-Z19 CO2 sensor.

7. **Nutrient Sensor**: Tracks the nutrient levels in the soil, ensuring proper feeding and nutrient balance for plant growth.
   - Example: TCS3200 Color Sensor (used to estimate nutrient levels).

8. **Water Level Sensor**: Useful if you plan to include an automated watering system in your pot. It helps monitor the water level in a reservoir.
   - Example: JSN-SR04T Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor.

9. **Air Quality Sensor**: Measures harmful gases or particulate matter in the air, ensuring the plant is in a healthy environment.
   - Example: MQ-135 Air Quality Sensor.

10. **Motion or Proximity Sensor**: Can be used for automating lights or cameras if the pot is part of a larger smart gardening system.
   - Example: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
