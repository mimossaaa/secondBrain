- **Millipedes:** Millipedes are elongated, segmented arthropods with two pairs of legs per body segment. They are detritivores, feeding on decaying plant matter, and play a crucial role in the decomposition process. These slow-moving creatures curl into a tight coil when threatened to protect their soft undersides.

- **Habitat:** Yellow-spotted millipedes thrive in the moist, cool environment of Redwood forests.

- **Role in Habitat:** They are essential in breaking down leaf litter, enriching the soil with nutrients.

- **Poison:** Yellow-spotted millipedes produce a mild toxin, hydrogen cyanide, which deters predators but is harmless to humans in small amounts.
