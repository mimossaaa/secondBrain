One of my biggest interests is in fashion. If I were not influenced by others I would want to create a brand. I fell into fashion as a freshman and ever since have grown my knowledge and wardrobe, while my bank account has shrunk. My biggest inspiration in fashion is Tremaine Emory. The way he puts a message in all of his pieces is so ingenious. I've always heard of the concept of the 3rd culture, but being mixed, I feel like I have 4 cultures inside of me, which is why I chose the name 4our for my brand. 4our would focus on creating unique accessories inspired by the cultures in my life. In my exploration of the 3d printing world, I have ended up creating some of my designs for accessories. One thing I recently made is a chain made of many 3d printed "4"s. A piece I have in the works is making grillz. Using Lightroom to make a model of my mouth, I would print the grillz. After printing, I want to engrave the geometric designs of the Amazigh tattoo style, to pay homage to my people.
