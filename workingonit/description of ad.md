The other night, dear  
As I lay sleeping  
I dreamed I held you  
In my arms  
When I awoke, dear  
I was mistaken  
So I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine  
My only sunshine  
You make me happy  
When skies are gray  
You'll never know, dear  
How much I love you  
Please don't take  
My sunshine away

This Nike ad encodes the brand's promise to provide perseverance, resilience, and a sense of identity for those who "join its cult" by becoming part of its community of athletes. It does this by presenting runners of various ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds, all facing the same challenging conditions—rain, puddles, and urban environments. This diverse representation communicates that Nike is inclusive, reaching out to a global audience while promising that anyone can endure adversity with the right mindset and tools (symbolized by Nike products).

The juxtaposition of the song "You Are My Sunshine" with the gritty imagery of runners enduring harsh conditions builds a contrast that subtly conveys an emotional promise: while external challenges (like "gray skies") are inevitable, Nike products and the culture they create will bring out inner strength and happiness. The runners don't stop; they keep going, embodying the ethos of determination and grit. The brand is encoding the idea that by using Nike products, you can align yourself with this resilience and "win" in the larger game of life—although the final line, "winning isn't easy," acknowledges that success comes only through hard work, a hallmark of Nike's messaging.

In essence, Nike promises to provide an empowering sense of belonging to a global community of athletes who push past adversity. It does this by showing relatable, diverse athletes and positioning the brand as integral to overcoming life's physical and emotional challenges, all while subtly displaying its products to reinforce the connection between performance and Nike gear.
