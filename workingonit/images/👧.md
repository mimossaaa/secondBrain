	i don’t want to leave this with a heavy heart. i know you said you don’t do well with in person apologies so if there’s something you’d like to say to me please do so. and if not then that’s fine too. i hope you find what you’re looking for and i hope that you are happy. all i ever wanted was for you to feel happy and safe. even if it’s no longer in my presence. i am being completely genuine when i say this. nothing i am saying to you is out of anger or spite. i wish that i could be there to celebrate the amazing things that you’ll do in the future. i wish i could be there to care for you.
	i want you to meet your person and fall so happily in love with them because they will be so worth it. worth every second of your time and every space that they take up in your mind. i trust that they will take care of you in the ways that i couldn’t. and that you cherish every moment and love them everyday. if somethings wrong and you really need someone i hope you know you have a friend in me. you can push me away but i’ll never stop caring for you.
